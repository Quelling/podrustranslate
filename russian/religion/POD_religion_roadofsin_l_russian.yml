 #Sinner-Group Faiths
 viapeccati:0 "Via Peccati"
 viapeccati_adj:0 "Peccati"
 viapeccati_adherent:0 "Sinner"
 viapeccati_adherent_plural:0 "Sinners"
 viapeccati_desc:0 "Followers of Via Peccati control their Beast by indulging their whims and desires, regardless of who they hurt. Failure to do as they please makes their condition worse, which means morals, ethics, and laws usually fall by the wayside as they make their way along this Road. Followers of Via Peccati are not evil per se; just completely self-indulgent."

 viavoluptuous:0 "Via Voluptuous"
 viavoluptuous_adj:0 "Voluptarius"
 viavoluptuous_adherent:0 "Voluptuaries"
 viavoluptuous_adherent_plural:0 "Voluptuaries"
 viavoluptuous_desc:0 "The Sinners of the Path of Pleasure are the most hedonistic of those that follow the Road of Sin. To them, pleasure is everything insofar as their existence is concerned, and absolutely nothing is taboo."

 viacrudelitas:0 "Via Crudelitas"
 viacrudelitas_adj:0 "Crudelitas"
 viacrudelitas_adherent:0 "Heartless"
 viacrudelitass_adherent_plural:0 "Heartless"
 viacrudelitas_desc:0 "The followers of the Path of Cruelty are the most cynical and hateful of the Sinners. Very much stemming from a 'hurt them before they hurt you' philosophy, the Sinners here do not believe in mercy, compassion, or pity. Rather, their only pleasure is derived from the pain of others."

 viaadversarius:0 "Via Adversarius"
 viaadversarius_adj:0 "Adversarius"
 viaadversarius_adherent:0 "Adversary"
 viaadversarius_adherent_plural:0 "Adversaries"
 viaadversarius_desc:0 "The 'Path of the Devil' is not to be confused with the so-called Via Diabolis, these Sinners work to keep themselves from being manipulated. The ultimate control freaks, they will go to extreme lengths to protect their free will and, unusually, the free will of others. Many consider them the most 'pleasant' of the Sinners."

 viadiabolis:0 "Via Diabolis"
 viadiabolis_adj:0 "Diabolis"
 viadiabolis_adherent:0 "Devil"
 viadiabolis_adherent_plural:0 "Devils"
 viadiabolis_desc:0 "Being an inherently destructive Road, Via Diabolis is not considered a path to be taken lightly; those who dare follow it indulge themselves with all manner of debauchery and destruction. Many are not really evil per se, so much as believing a virtuous unlife is a fruitless pursuit. Some, however, took the role of devil seriously, even calling themselves devils incarnate and servants of Satan. The Baali in particular are associated with Via Diabolis."

 viaprometheus:0 "Via Prometheus"
 viaprometheus_adj:0 "Promethean"
 viaprometheus_adherent:0 "Promethean"
 viaprometheus_adherent_plural:0 "Promethean"
 viaprometheus_desc:0 "Also called Firebringers, they are a sect of Cainites who dream of re-creating Carthage and the harmony of Kindred and Kine associated with it. Unsurprisingly, many members are Brujah. Since many members of the High Clans regard these visions as treason, the Prometheans are forced to act covertly."

 viafurores_adherent:0 "Furores"
 viafurores_adherent_plural:0 "Furores"
 viafurores_desc:0 "This sect's members have a reputation for being the outlaws of the Cainites. Condemned by most princes as thieves and troublemakers, they exist on the fringes of vampire society, scratching out a meager existence like their mortal counterparts. The Furores are considered chaotic, but they can muster a level of passion for their cause unseen anywhere else in Cainite society."

 viaquiritare_adj:0 "Quiritare"
 viaquiritare_adherent:0 "Screamer"
 viaquiritare_adherent_plural:0 "Screamers"
 viaquiritare_desc:0 "The maddest of the Sinners and the opposites of Via Adversarius, the followers of the Path of Screams believe that as they are already damned, they are also already prey to the Beast, and therefore allow themselves to be manipulated by it to do the Beast's bidding. They are essentially walking examples of Hell-on-Earth; even other Sinners are loathe to associate with these madmen."

Vampires on this path devote themselves to serving the gods through making regular sacrifices, honoring and protecting that which the gods deem sacred, and adhering to strict codes of honor."
 
 viacain:0 "Cainite Heresy"
 viacain_adj:0 "Cainite"
 viacain_adherent:0 "Cainite"
 viacain_adherent_plural:0 "Cainites"
 viacain_desc:0 "The Cainite Heresy is a heretical belief that is practiced mainly by Christian Cainites, mostly but not exclusively by Lasombra vampires. It is steeped heavily in Gnosticism and employs a flock of human priests and clerics. Historically, the Heresy sprang forth from various blood cults in which vampires were worshipped as gods. Vampires, due their incorruptible bodies, their independence from the material world and the power that their disciplines grant, were regarded by some Gnostics as creatures of higher spirituality and were sought after for teachings in exchange for vitae."
 
 viahyron:0 "Via Hyron"
 viahyron_adj:0 "Abelene"
 viahyron_adherent:0 "Abelene"
 viahyron_adherent_plural:0 "Abelenes"
 viahyron_desc:0 "The Road of the Hive is followed almost exclusively by the Baali of the Order of Moloch. The Road preaches all-encompassing loyalty to the bloodline as a whole and to one's sire in particular. The main reason for this is that the Great Works that the Baali want to achieve cannot be claimed alone or when they interfere with the work of others. The vampire had to let the voices of the Swarm inside his soul in order to understand the dreams of the beings of the Outer Darkness and keep them asleep. Apart from that, most other vampires would actively destroy a Baali if he would be foolish enough to reveal himself as an adherent."
