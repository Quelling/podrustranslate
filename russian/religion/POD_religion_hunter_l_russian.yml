 shadowinquisition_desc:0 "The Shadow Inquisition is a secret campaign orchestrated by the Catholic Church during the Dark Medieval period. Unlike the Papal Inquisition, which is targeted at heretics, the Shadow Inquisition targets vampires, werewolves, mages and other "servants of Satan" for either destruction or salvation. Its existence will be short lived, but its successes will change the Cainite world forever."
