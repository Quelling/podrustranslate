The hunter's skill was great, as they looked for their Father, and they did see... ancient Discipline used they to find the road of Shal-ka-mense. They came at last to that secret place where Caine hid, amongst the waters, showing himself, Caine called them under, "Gentle sons, gentle daughters, Why do you disturb my slumber?" And they tried to embrace their Father with steely things and things of wood, but lightning Caine, fast-moving Caine, would not be stopped by such as them. Under the curling, blasting waters, beyond the pool of Veyd-sah-me, in the grotto of Shal-ka-mense did they gather, to embrace their sleeping Father's form. Found him sleeping? Found him wakeful, battle-ready, eyes abright, smiling at his ancient childer waging war in the waxing light. Now the stars they one by one blot their ways into lightning sky, now the fires burn hell and cinder, now the heat reveals the pyre. Too long! The hunters waited further, Too long! They did by Veyd-sah-me, tarry long enough to see the light of Dawn upon their Father's Face. And in the turning, burning Mark, they saw the Finger of God's own hate, twisting, curling, God's own Word it set apart Caine's lonely fate. And as they burned in hell-bright fires, as they saw the melted flesh, as they burned with their own Kindred, Caine blessed more funeral pyres, taking in his bloody Sacrament. Seek no the blood of thine own Elder, seek not the blood of thy Sire's Sire, seek not that made thee Kin, for thou will feel the funeral pyre, when thou dost pay for thy immortal sin."

I have seen the faceless hooded ones traversing River Styx. They swarm about us like flies on a putrefying corpse, and like us, feed on fear, ecstasy, and anger. Dead they are, but undead, and they are closer to us than we will ever know. The Blood of my Brother cries out to me as I sleep as the Sun crosses the sky, I hear my brother, second-born Abel, screaming.

 tenet_enkrateia_reie_sophrosyne_name:0 "Enkrateia Reie Sophrosyne"
 tenet_enkrateia_reie_sophrosyne_desc:0 "An intellectual approach to unlife, the Path focuses on three fundamental concepts believed to have been essential characteristics sought in potential Brujah progeny in the nights of Carthage: enkrateia, reie, and sophrosyne. Enkrateia refers to inner strength. It is not enough for the Philosopher to passively accept the frustrations that come her way, as the Path of Humanity requires. Instead, she must hone her reason into a sword and her will into a shield against the forces that would cause her to degenerate.\n\nIn practical terms, this means that Philosophers usually have high Willpower and Self-Control ratings or else aggressively pursue those traits.\n\nReie refers to moral courage. The Philosopher must not shirk her responsibility to pursue either enlightenment or moral character out of fear of frenzy or other degradations. Instead, she must confront difficult situations with reason and self-discipline, eschewing the impetuosity that defines the modern Brujah.\n\nSophrosyne means control of the self and represents the idealized goal of all Philosophers: mastery over the Brujah rage. It also means that the Brujah has committed to an eternity of mental, spiritual, and physical development. Philosophers develop sophrosyne by working to improve Physical and Mental Attributes and Abilities, rather than focusing on Disciplines or Social traits."
