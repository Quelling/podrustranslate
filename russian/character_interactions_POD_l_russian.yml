 POD_inquihunt.12.desc:0 "You are impressed by this fiend's craftiness. Most of your precedent targets fell quite easily once you spun your web of intrigue around them but this one... this one struck back. Hard.\nYour own network is attacked, with vicious rumors targeting you in particular. You know you can with this shadow war, but it will cost you a great deal to repair the damage caused by your foe. Pushing just a little more would allow you the joy of bringing this vampire to your best torture chamber though... Decisions, decisions."

 POD_inquihunt.13.desc:0 "You stood no chance. Every one of your actions was anticipated, every move you made easily countered. You were but a child playing a game of chess without knowing the rules. This vampire probably invented the game.\nEven when you understood the danger you were in, it was far too late. And so, you are now being tortured nightly by the one you foolishly wanted to destroy. And even in this particular field, he knows so much more than you do..."

 POD_inquihunt.14.t:0 "Know Thy Enemy"
 POD_inquihunt.14.desc:0 "You were quite happy to see that you had some old mentions of the particular fiend you tracked down in your books. You were even happier to learn of his peculiar attachment to a still living mortal family. As if these creatures could still feel mortal emotions!/nWell, no matter, this was an easy enough information to exploit. By using these mortals as bait, you managed to lure the vampire into a carefully planned trap in hallowed ground. This specific fiend turned instantly to ashes upon entering the area, an observation you were quick to consign in your journal."
 POD_inquihunt.14.option.a:0 "This might come in handy for the next one"
 POD_inquihunt.15.t:0 "A Book too far"
 POD_inquihunt.15.desc:0 "This fiend is elusive. He already has avoided two of your carefully planned traps, and you are starting to lose some ground, as several of your agents have gone missing.\nA possibility remains though, one you choose not to use until now given its...'mystical' nature. The Holy Church would certainly not approve of such a choice, but perhaps the death of this specific vampire is worth more than your reputation?"
 POD_inquihunt.15.option.a:0 "God is forgiving after all..."

 POD_inquihunt.16.t:0 "If you look into the Abyss..."
 POD_inquihunt.16.desc:0 "You don't really know when it started. You found one reference of the vampire in an old book, then another... and you started to read. And even more when new books were brought to you by some agents you don't remember hiring.\nYou have been lost for quite some time in your work and you have dug deep, probably too deep. At least, that is what the Church thinks, as you were reported on by one of your Knights for your 'heretical' readings. And so, here you are, at a burning stake once again, but this time not in the public..."
 POD_inquihunt.16.option.a:0 "I was so close to the truth! So close!"
 POD_inquihunt.17.t:0 "Holy Fury"
 POD_inquihunt.17.desc:0 "They weren't expecting a frontal assault. That's what you conclude after having cleaved your way through a significant number of unprepared thralls of the vampire before finding his resting place. Although you have attacked by day, the ruckus of the battle has awakened the fiend who was waiting for you.\nYou must admit he made a good show of himself, sluggish as they are in daytime, but all in all, you still quite easily cut his head off before he could really get his bearings in this battle. One less bloodsucker on God's fair Earth."
 POD_inquihunt.17.option.a:0 "So, where is the next one?"
 POD_inquihunt.18.t:0 "A Worthy Opponent"
 POD_inquihunt.18.desc:0 "This one is tough. Despite having easily dispatched most of his guards, and attacked during the daytime, this fiend is still a formidable foe. You are confident that you will win, thanks to God's light, but it is a slow and arduous process.\nWorse still, this long battle has given time for other thralls of the vampire to intervene. You could probably beat them too, but you won't emerge unscathed for such a fight..."
 POD_inquihunt.18.option.a:0 "I will win, no matter the cost"
 POD_inquihunt.18.option.b:0 "I must preserve myself for future battles"
 POD_inquihunt.19.t:0 "Outmatched"
 POD_inquihunt.19.desc:0 "So this how it ends. The fiend, despite being attacked during daytime, is much stronger, faster and tougher than you are. You came to this conclusion quite early in your confrontation and have made your peace with it.\nNow, it is merely a question of holding him long enough for your troops to fall back and live another day, which you are pretty sure is finally done. With one final strike, the vampire is preparing to end you. But you are more at peace than he ever will, as God is waiting for you on the other side."
