 podintroductions.1.desc:0 "As mortal France is reeling under the internal chaos of the albigensian crusade, vampiric France fares no better. Alexander, a 4th generation Ventrue, was prince of Paris and France until less than two years ago. He was ousted by a palace coup led by the Toreador Salianna, and his own childe, Geoffrey du Temple. The Toreador Queen has assumed control of the country and tries to consolidate her position, facing the opposition of her own clansmates, the other queens of France. On the other hand, Geoffrey has taken Paris itself as its prize but could, given time, made a bid for the crown that is his by right of blood. To the south, Esclarmonde of Toulouse is using the cathar uprising for her own purpose but could face the fury of northern France soon enough. Will the country finds a new, better, ruler than Alexander from this ordeal? Or will it be swept away in chaos and destruction?"
 podintroductions.1.a:0 "France would fare better under my rule…"
 podintroductions.2.t:0 "The bored God-King of England"
 podintroductions.2.desc:0 "Vampiric history of Britannia is closely linked to the Ventrue Mithras. Persian, than Roman, god, this 4th generation almost had the whole of Europe following his cult before Christianity drove him out. Retreating with his zealots in the land of the Brits, he quickly gathered power… and grew bored of the pettiness of the place. Failing regularly into torpor, the Norman invasion destroyed his seat of power and forced him to awoken to restore order. 150 years later, Mithras couldn’t care less about England again, and many of his subjects, like Hugh of Cornwall or Robin Leeland, have obtained de facto independence and plot his demise. Worse, Wales and Scotland are still upholding ancient cells of Druidic and Nordic Kindred. None can really say if Mithras will once again crush this new opposition or just let it fester under his nose until it’s too late."
 podintroductions.2.a:0 "All hail the God-King… for now."
 podintroductions.3.t:0 "Land of Kings and Warlocks"
 podintroductions.3.desc:0 "The undisputed heart of clan Ventrue, Germany is firmly in the hands of Hardestadt. Still, even his rule isn’t unchallenged, by pretenders like Julia Antasia of Western Germany or the elusive Ilse Reinegger of Bavaria. To the south, the usurpers of clan Tremere have a precarious position, with the vicious Tzimisce of Eastern Europe closing fast on their strongholds. Their defensive accord with the mighty Ventrue is perhaps their only lifeline. Close by lies Alexander of Paris, the exiled prince of France, a powerful Vampire by his own right, but alone politically. Hardestadt must act quickly, quelling the ambitions of his childe Jurgen, destroying Julia and Ilse powerbases and securing his eastern front with or without Tremere’s help. Germany will be the crown jewel of clan Ventrue, or burn trying."

 podintroductions.4.t:0 "Shadow Reconquista"
 podintroductions.4.desc:0 "Iberia is the traditional center of power of clan Lasombra but the mortal Reconquista has plunged the Magisters into a bitter civil war. To the north, Sylvester de Ruiz leads the official, Christian, clan Lasombra and has the clear ambition of ruling all of Iberia. He must take notice of his ambitious vassals though, the like of Ambrosio Luis Moncada or Lucita of Aragon. To the south, after decades of infighting, the Muslim Lasombra –who call themselves Ashirra- have found in Badr of Andalusia a worthy and proven sultan. Elsewhere, new and old princes, from regal Ventrue to feral Gangrel, take notice of the weakness of the Magisters and wait for the right moment to strike. This Reconquista could be the last breath of the Lasombra dominance of Iberia."
 podintroductions.4.a:0 "Iberia will be whole again, just give me time."
 podintroductions.5.t:0 "Ragnarok"
 podintroductions.5.desc:0 "Long gone from the mortals minds, the Norse faith still exists for Vampires of Scandinavia. Its proponents, the fierce Einherjar, cling to their beliefs… but hope is fading fast. The All-High Werter and the leader of the Valkyries, Ulfsdottir, have retreated into depression and near torpor. Some continue the fight though, like Brunhilde and Valbjorg ‘Crooked-Eye’, trying to destroy the invading Christian Vampires, led by Hardestadt’ get. One glimmer of optimism for the Einherjar is that the newcomers are hardly an united bunch, squabbling among themselves, most notably in Denmark which is divided between three pretenders. In the northern wastes, a band of callous furores calling themselves the Bar Sinister have staked a dubious claim on the barren land. Be they new allies or foes, the last battle of the Norse is drawing near, and the Cross seems like the clear favorite once again..."
 podintroductions.5.a:0 "Scandinavia will never be the same."
 podintroductions.6.t:0 "Requiem for an Empire"
 podintroductions.6.desc:0 "If mortal medieval Italy is a divided state, then Italy by Night is a powder keg. Powerful old Vampires scramble for the most populous cities of Europe. To the north, Ventrue ‘cardinal’ Fabrizio Ulfila seats in Milan, a strong grasp on the Italian Church at his disposal. In Venezia, the Giovanni scions of Clan Cappadocian are masters of a sea spanning trade empire, time will tell if their focus is on Italy proper or in the East, like their parent clan. In Sicily, the capital of clan Lasombra is guarded by the faithful Montano, but overextension and the civil war in Spain have left the Sea of Shadows vulnerable. Finally, all eyes are on Rome, where Titus Venturus Camille has recently awoken. The Eternal Consul was the mastermind behind Rome’s empire and Carthage’s destruction and could usher a new age for Ventrue leadership. As other petty leaders and immortals kings rise elsewhere in Italy, the War of Princes has never been more dangerous than here."

 podintroductions.7.t:0 "Against the Wall"
 podintroductions.7.desc:0 "The Crusader States stand precariously on the Levant, and an even more precarious Vampire state has risen in their midst. The Diet of Olives is a pact between the princes of various cities of the area, headed by a survivor, Qawiyya el-Ghaduba. The “Lioness” is a Salubri, a clan almost extinct in Western Europe since the death of their founder, Saulot, at the hands of the newly risen Tremere clan. Most members of the weakened clan have gone into hiding, but Qawiyya intends to make a stand. Her precarious alliance is already in danger though, as mighty Damascus is falling into a literal pit of madness. Darshuf, the old Toreador sultan has sold his soul to untold forces, with only his childe and a lone Assamite warrior standing on the way of a catastrophe. Will the Diet be the last hurrah of a dying clan or the hope of a brighter future?"
 podintroductions.7.a:0 "Jerusalem is the city of miracles, after all…"
 podintroductions.8.t:0 "Behind the Veil"
 podintroductions.8.desc:0 "Arabia is the seat of the Ashirra movement, Muslim vampires united beyond clans by their common faith. Their position on the peninsula is strong, but the loss of Jerusalem to the crusaders and of Egypt to the Serpents has cut them from their Maghrebi and Andalusian brothers. Even worse, Mesopotamia has fallen to the infernalists Baali once more, lead by Azanael of the Nergalite branch. His goal is to take the great cities of the region, Damascus, Baghdad and Tyr, to have the population he requires to sacrifice for his unholy master’s return. Ironically, his strongest opponent is Tanit of Tyr, another Baali, this one of the Molochim branch. This rivalry has plunged the resurgent Baali into civil war and gives hope to the Muslim faithful that they can be stopped. If not… then, the entire world could be at stake."

 podintroductions.9.t:0 "Cloak and Scimitar"
 podintroductions.9.desc:0 "Persia is the seat of the Assamite clan, a mysterious group for outsiders. Ruled by the newly crowned and very contested Eldest, Nakurtum, their facade of unity is showing cracks as various factions make their power plays. Thetmes of the Web of Knives wants the clan to become a fanatic cult of assassins prepared to serve as an army for the return of his black master. Al Ashrad of the Sorcerers is walking a path of moderation, viewing the Assamites as judges and diplomats. Finally, Jamal of the Warriors is a devout Muslim, and would welcome a rapprochement with the Ashirra Caliphate of Medina. This political unrest has helped the growth of another group in the region, the Lost Tribe of Dastur Anosh, an heretic venerating the Second Generation of vampires. Crippled by divisions and inefficiency, will the Assamite clan find a new common purpose or implodes into civil war?"
 podintroductions.9.a:0 "I will unite Persia, by diplomacy or else."
 podintroductions.11.t:0 "The Eternal War"
 podintroductions.11.desc:0 "Since the dawn of time, India has been the theater of a war between clan Ravnos and the asuratizayya, or Wan Kuei, a mysterious group of Asian 'Vampires'. There has been no victors and both combatants are at their breaking point, with various factions plotting to overthrow the current leadership. In the West, Chandraputra is marshaling the Ravnos for one more battle. While in the East, Dyanang leads the Dragons towards yet another charge. Other powers, from the Daena to Kartarirya of the Tzimisce, look hungrily for opportunities in the constant storm. Will a winner finally emerges?"
 podintroductions.11.a:0 "I am, obviously, the only hope for peace in India."
 podintroductions.12.t:0 "Still Falling"
 podintroductions.12.desc:0 "Although it has been burnt centuries ago, the loss of Carthage is still felt in the Maghreb. The area has since been carved between various Ashirra -Muslim Vampires- sultans, but none of them has really managed to consolidate the region. The two best poised to do so are Sophoniba, the very old leader of Tunis who still remembers the loss of her city alongside Carthage, and Zamra Matoub of Algiers, a young and ambitious Lasombra. The Setites also have a foothold here, as do clan Tremere. With this divided patchwork or powers, and rich history, the Maghreb is a tantalizing prize for any adventurous prince or sultan."

 podintroductions.13.desc:0 "Egypt has endured many foreign conquerors, and its native undead are nothing if not patient and resilient. The real power here lies in Gizeh, with the heart of clan Setite. The clan of freedom –or corruption depending on who you ask- is preparing its forces to profit from the vacuum of power created by the crusades. Their first target will undoubtedly be Cairo. Led by the powerful 5th generation Ventrue Antonius, the city won’t fall easily though and could thwart the Serpents if open war was declared. Everyone is sure that the Followers of Set will make their first move soon, but nobody can say when, and if, they will be stopped when they do…"

 podintroductions.14.t:0 "Land of Duality"
 podintroductions.14.desc:0 "Africa's native Vampires are the Laibon, a loose association of multiple bloodlines and self created bloodsuckers. They hold most of the true power in the continent but must contend with the many adventurers or petty warlords looking for fame and fortune in their lands. Even worse, Africa is also home to some truly ancient creatures, still there from the time where it was the cradle of humanity. With various new roads opening with the Muslim, and Ashirra, world, it remains to be seen if the Laibon will be able to adapt and prosper in the changing times."

 podintroductions.15.desc:0 "To outsiders, Tibet is home to very strange Vampires... if they can be called Vampires at all! The so called White Exiles are part of the Wan Kuei, the Hungry Ghosts of China, and are firmly established in the east. In the west though, even stranger things dwell from demon worshiping abominations to illuminated followers of a dead Egyptian god. Far away from any true center of undead power, Tibet is very much a sideshow to most Vampires. But mysteries can hold rewards to those who seek deep enough..."

 podintroductions.16.desc:0 "The steppes aren’t a land for Vampires. Few cities to hide, few nations to manipulate and bend to their will. But, from the east comes a new breed of Vampires, one that is at home on the unending plains and with the nomadic Mongol people. These Anda, a Gangrel offshoot, are proud warriors and follow the massively expanding Mongol Empire with its conquests. Conflict with the already present Gangrel of the west seems inevitable and, even further, tensions with the European Cainites are to be expected when these newcomers arrive. Change is a rare thing to come by with Vampires, but when it comes with a thunderous horde of horse archers, change could be the last thing many of them experience…"

 podintroductions.17.desc:0 "Eastern Europe is the traditional land of the Tzimisce clan, but their hegemony has been recently contested by the rise of the Tremere, backed by German and Hungarian Ventrue. A recent war has been ended with a bitter peace treaty between Vladimir Rustovitch, voivode of voivodes, and Jurgen von Verden, Ventrue crusader. A buffer state, the Obertus Order, has been established, headed by the broker of peace Myka Vykos. Now, everyone lick their wounds, Rustovitch trying to assure his control of the clan and the Hungarian Ventrue solving a succession crisis with the torpor of their leader, Bulscu. Finally, Etrius is leading the Usurpers in Tremere's stead, showing the facade of an unified pyramid against the fiends. Everyone knows that war is inevitable in this region until a Vampire stands powerful enough to crush his rivals once and for all. Who will it be?"

 podintroductions.18.desc:0 "The ashes of Constantinople are still hot and, yet, vultures are already circling over its corpse. Michael’s Dream, a vampiric utopia never seen since Carthage, has fallen with its creator, and a number of warlords and remnants of the broken Empire are trying to survive. The most important of them is Alfonzo, one of the instigators of the 4th Crusade, now holding Constantinople. The ambitious Lasombra still bow to the clan leaders in Sicily, but for how long? Further west, Natalya Svyatoslav of the Brujah is one of the last true believers of the Dream still active, hoping to claim the mantle of the ‘Archangel’ Michael for herself. Anna Comnena hasn't such lofty ambitions, using Nikaea to finally get the Empire that should have been hers even during her breathing days. As many others aspiring princes build domains in the ashes of the old, Constantinople could be reborn anew… or dead for good."

This 4th generation Nosferatu, rumored to be the true progenitor of the clan, is very much part of the land, and uses it to defend herself against her vengeful sire. Luckily for all in the area, the witch is in torpor. But the influence of her Shadow Curtain is still felt, nurtured by her loyal second in command, Viktor. With such conditions, there are only three types of Vampires in Russia : the vassals of the Grandmother, the brave, and the soon to be dead.

The crumbling authority of the Voivodes, and their utter anachronism, has allowed a new generation of Vampires to take hold and prosper. First among them is Yitzhak ben Avraham, a devout Brujah, gathering followers around Krakow to expel the bygone prince, Razkoljna. This could be the first step towards a Poland free of Tzimisce's influence.

Further north, Karl the Blue is leading an Einherjar Free State, perhaps the last of its kind as Scandinavia is falling to Hardestadt's minions.

You won't die of old age or disease, but being put to the torch or decapitated will still end your unlife. As such, succession is a lesser, but still present, concern for you. In the same vein, Marriages can't produce children, so they are mostly a political tool available to a select few religions. \nReligions are a core part of the gameplay, even more than in CK3. Here, it represents the core philosophical tenets of your character, which help him not fall to the Beast. Indeed, the Beast -a literal manifestation of your inner monstrosity- is one of your worst foes, and managing your stress is paramount to not fall prey to it, as it would mean your character has become a feral wight, resulting in his abdication.\nTake notice of your hunger, a core modifier representing your need for blood.

Most are capped by a stat like control and you will have to choose how to balance these. Note that major centers of populations, represented by high development duchy capitals are the biggest asset any Prince can dream of.\nWarfare is sensibly altered, with a bigger emphasis on knights. The prowess of your knights can easily overcome a much more numerous foe, especially if mostly composed of levies. As such, be very wary of high prowess hostile Vampires.\nIn a world full of deceit and tricks, intrigue plays a bigger role.
