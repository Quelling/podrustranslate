 PODthorns.0002.t:0 "The Convention of Thorns"
 PODthorns.0002.desc:0 "As the Anarch Revolt rages across the Cainite world, helped by the still present Inquisition, an unprecedented event has happened. Several elders of various clans have called for a peace meeting, and the establishment of a new organization for the Kindred.\nThis organization, the Camarilla, would be an all inclusive sect concerning itself with protecting the Masquerade and the relations between elders and neonates. Many people, especially among the Anarchs, are wary of this initiative but it is already a surprising political success, as representatives from almost all of Europe are gathering to talk about this proposal.\nThe future of the Kindred might be decided in this small English town in the coming nights."
 PODthorns.0002.a:0 "Change is coming"
 thorn_begins_effect_message:0 "Each clan will choose a stance regarding this proposal. If you are strong enough, you might be the representative for your own clan." 
 PODthorns.0003.t:0 "Thorns : The Ventrue"
 PODthorns.0003.desc:0 "Old habits are immortals and, as such, it is Clan Ventrue that will open the Convention. Many are expecting the Kings to find a way to assure their leadership over any new sect. Their choice is also very likely to impact their traditional rivals as rulers of the night, the Lasombra and Tzimisce."
 PODthorns.0003.a:0 "The Camarilla is the future"
 PODthorns.0003.b:0 "We will never be part of this lunacy!"
 PODthorns.0003.c:0 "Neutrality is the key to our survival"
 choose_camarilla_effect_message:0 "You join the Camarilla, most of the clan will follow you" 
 choose_opposition_effect_message:0 "You stand in opposition, joining the Anarchs with most of your clan" 
 choose_independance_effect_message:0 "Nothing change for you or your clan" 
 PODthorns.0004.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Ventrue"
 PODthorns.0004.desc:0 "In a not so surprising move, the Ventrue have aligned themselves with the nascent Camarilla, probably hoping to take the reins of power while they still can. The Convention continues as the other representatives discuss this move."
 PODthorns.0004.a:0 "A victory for the Camarilla"
 PODthorns.0004.b:0 "I must join them!"
 PODthorns.0005.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Ventrue"
 PODthorns.0005.desc:0 "Surprising turn of events in the opening stages of the Convention of Thorns, as the Ventrue representative has stormed out of the negotiation table, calling the whole process a sad joke. It seems that Clan Ventrue will take no part in the Camarilla and has aligned itself with the Anarch opposition, perhaps hoping to bring order to the so far leaderless movement."
 PODthorns.0005.a:0 "A victory for the Opposition"
 PODthorns.0006.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Ventrue"
 PODthorns.0006.desc:0 "Surprising turn of events in the opening stages of the Convention of Thorns, as the Ventrue representative has announced the total neutrality of his clan for the foreseeable future. Perhaps the Ventrue weren't in a position to claim leadership over the burgeoning sects? That is what is claimed by the emboldened Lasombra and Tzimisce negotiators, who now smell opportunity to take a leading role themselves."
 PODthorns.0006.a:0 "What makes a clan turns neutral?"
 PODthorns.0007.t:0 "Thorns : The Lasombra"
 PODthorns.0007.desc:0 "As the Lasombra representative prepares his statement, many expect the Magisters to be on the opposite side of the Ventrue. There can be only so many ruling clans in one sect after all."
 PODthorns.0008.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Lasombra"
 PODthorns.0008.desc:0 "In a passionate speech, the Lasombra representative declares his clan fully in favor of the nascent Camarilla. Already outlining a plan for its institutions, apparently following the hierarchy of the mortal Church, many expect the Magisters to be on the leading seat of the new sect."
 PODthorns.0009.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Lasombra"
 PODthorns.0009.desc:0 "It seems the Camarilla will have a powerful foe in the form of Clan Lasombra. Its representative has cursed the proposed resolution and left the Convention in a hurry. Rallying around the Anarch cause, the Magisters are already preparing a draft for their own new sect."
 PODthorns.0010.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Lasombra"
 PODthorns.0010.desc:0 "It seems that Clan Lasombra is done pretending to the throne of rulers of the night. As their representative announces their choice of neutrality, others are already theorizing that the Magisters will now focus their efforts on more shadowy, mystical matters."
 PODthorns.0011.t:0 "Thorns : The Brujah"
 PODthorns.0011.desc:0 "A large majority of the original Anarch movement, members of the Brujah Clan are still quite divided on how to approach the Convention. Some sees it as an humiliating surrender, others as the possibility of an honorable peace treaty. With such a divided, and passionate, outlook on the negotiation, it will be up to their representative to be the deciding voice."
 PODthorns.0012.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Brujah"
 PODthorns.0012.desc:0 "Finally, the Brujah have laid down their weapons. It was a long, arduous process but a peace has been signed. The clan is now an integral part of the Camarilla, despite the grumblings of its hardliners."
 PODthorns.0013.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Brujah"
 PODthorns.0013.desc:0 "War never changes, as does the Brujah. The rebellious clan has refused to step down and sign a peace treaty with the nascent Camarilla. The Anarch Revolt continues on, but some are looking into reforming the divided movement into a more cohesive sect, to better continue the fight."
 PODthorns.0014.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Brujah"
 PODthorns.0014.desc:0 "Few could have predicted the outcome of the negotiation for Clan Brujah. In a determined speech, its representative has simply said that they will never bow down again to another authority. As such, the Brujah leave the convention as divided as they entered it."
 PODthorns.0015.t:0 "Thorns : The Malkavian"
 PODthorns.0015.desc:0 "Let us be honest. Nobody has any clues of the stance that Clan Malkavian will take during the convention, probably not even their representative. Still, as dangerous as they are, the lunatics are not to be underestimated, and are courted by the many factions gathered here."
 PODthorns.0016.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Malkavian"
 PODthorns.0016.desc:0 "Clan Malkav has joined the Camarilla to the prudent applause of the representatives of this sect. Although some would call such help a curse, the nascent Camarilla seems satisfied to have the dangerous prophets on their side."
 PODthorns.0017.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Malkavian"
 PODthorns.0017.desc:0 "It seems Clan Malkav has foreseen... something important about the Anarch Revolt it seems. Their representative, in a somewhat lurid description of an apocalyptic event, has officially rallied his clan to the cause of the rebellion. The Anarchs, for their part, are as surprised as anyone else by this sudden turn of events."
 PODthorns.0018.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Malkavian"
 PODthorns.0018.desc:0 "Returning back to its roots as a clan of prophets and councilors, the Malkavians have stated their neutrality in the ongoing conflict. It seems that everyone will have the dubious pleasure of handling them in the future."
 PODthorns.0019.t:0 "Thorns : The Toreador"
 PODthorns.0019.desc:0 "Although Michael is long gone, the Toreador are still a powerful clan with a solid power base across Europe. As they were the first to put forward the idea of the enforced Masquerade for the Camarilla, they will probably choose this sect. But their passionate nature can also bring them close to the Revolt..."
 PODthorns.0020.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Toreador"
 PODthorns.0020.desc:0 "As expected, Clan Toreador has formally joined the Camarilla, their concern for the enforcing of the Masquerade having outweighed their passionate spirit."
 PODthorns.0021.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Toreador"
 PODthorns.0021.desc:0 "Burning passion and emotion have won the day, as the Toreador representative made a rousing speech praising the Anarch cause. It seems the traditional alliance of the Toreador with the ruling clans is over, for now."
 PODthorns.0022.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Toreador"
 PODthorns.0022.desc:0 "Surprising everyone, the Toreador representative announced the neutrality of his clan for the foreseeable future. Perhaps the Roses have been fed up of war and rebellion?"
 PODthorns.0023.t:0 "Thorns : The Tremere"
 PODthorns.0023.desc:0 "The Magii have made an explosive entrance into the world of Kindred politics and many would like nothing more than to see them crushed for good. It is likely that they will join the Camarilla, hoping to find shelter in it, in exchange for their powerful mastery of blood sorcery at the sect's disposal."
 PODthorns.0024.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Tremere"
 PODthorns.0024.desc:0 "Like most of the convention expected, the Tremere have pledged their allegiance to the Camarilla. Many see them as the real power behind the throne in the nascent sect already."
 PODthorns.0025.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Tremere"
 PODthorns.0025.desc:0 "Surprising event at the Convention, as the Tremere have announced their support for the Anarch Movement. Is this a failure in their pyramid or a part of a grander scheme?"
 PODthorns.0026.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Tremere"
 PODthorns.0026.desc:0 "It seems the Mages will bow to no one but their own, as their representative has announced their neutrality in the ongoing conflict. No doubt their services as mercenary sorcerers will be highly sought after."
 PODthorns.0027.t:0 "Thorns : The Tzimisce"
 PODthorns.0027.desc:0 "The powerful clan of the Eastern Fiends is expected to take a stand in opposition to the hated Tremere foes. Neutrality is also an option seriously considered by many of its older members, as they mostly don't care for the world outside their gloomy castles."
 PODthorns.0028.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Tzimisce"
 PODthorns.0028.desc:0 "Although the debate was hard fought, the Tzimisce Clan agreed to join the Camarilla. Many finer details still remain to be debated though, like the Masquerade in Transylvania..."
 PODthorns.0029.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Tzimisce"
 PODthorns.0029.desc:0 "Confusion and anger run hot at the Convention of Thorns as the Tzimisce representative just launched an oversized part of his anatomy at one of his opponents before storming out. It seems that the Tzimisce aren't pleased by the Camarilla's proposal."
 PODthorns.0030.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Tzimisce"
 PODthorns.0030.desc:0 "The oldest members of clan Tzimisce seem to have won the internal debate, as their representative just announced the neutrality of the Fiends in the ongoing war. Many have expressed concern as the state of the Masquerade in Transylvania with such a decision."
 PODthorns.0031.t:0 "Thorns : The Gangrel"
 PODthorns.0031.desc:0 "The Gangrel can't deny it anymore, their world is dying. No matter their prowess below the night sky, their mortals have been swayed by the Cross or the Crescent. In this rapidly changing environment, many are looking for a place to belong. Every faction would love to be that place."
 PODthorns.0032.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Gangrel"
 PODthorns.0032.desc:0 "The Gangrel representative has grudgingly accepted to join the Camarilla. Perhaps the clan will find a new purpose as enforcers and blood hounds of this sect now."
 PODthorns.0033.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Gangrel"
 PODthorns.0033.desc:0 "Some would say that the Gangrel have caved to their feral side, as they have chosen to pledge their support to the Anarch cause, perhaps looking for a war worth fighting. A tremendous boon for the rebels in any case."
 PODthorns.0034.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Gangrel"
 PODthorns.0034.desc:0 "The wary Clan Gangrel seems to have enough of this strange, new world they find themselves thrown into. Declaring their neutrality, only they will choose the next target of their unending hunt."
 PODthorns.0035.t:0 "Thorns : The Nosferatu"
 PODthorns.0035.desc:0 "At a first glance, the Nosferatu seem very keen on the idea of the Camarilla. Always looking for protection against the horrors of their progenitor, they seek strength in numbers. With shrewd diplomacy, they could find it in a different solution though."
 PODthorns.0036.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Nosferatu"
 PODthorns.0036.desc:0 "It wasn't a big surprise when the representative of the Nosferatu announced the total support of his clan for the nascent Camarilla. The new sect can count on a loyal and powerful web of informants from now on."
 PODthorns.0037.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Nosferatu"
 PODthorns.0037.desc:0 "Surprising news during the Convention of Thorns, the Nosferatu have joined with the Anarch movement. Many wonder if the Hidden Ones have some secret information that have tipped the balance against the Camarilla..."
 PODthorns.0038.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Nosferatu"
 PODthorns.0038.desc:0 "It took several nights before this was noticed, but the Nosferatu representative has disappeared from the Convention. It seems the Hidden Ones won't take part in the birth of the sects."
 PODthorns.0039.t:0 "Thorns : The Followers of Set"
 PODthorns.0039.desc:0 "Although they have been officially invited to join the Camarilla, nobody really expect the children of Set to accept. Their mystical ways make them very much at odds with the proposed framework of the new sect."
 PODthorns.0040.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Setites"
 PODthorns.0040.desc:0 "As the representative of the Followers of Set accepts the proposition to join the Camarilla before a stunned audience, all are already wondering what the ulterior motive behind this choice is. Has the snake just been accepted into the garden?"
 PODthorns.0041.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Setites"
 PODthorns.0041.desc:0 "It seems the creation of the Camarilla, a centralized authority for vampires, has way more angered the Setites than anyone expected. Talking about the perception of Set as a 'Grand Liberator', their representative has pledged the clan to the Anarch's cause."
 PODthorns.0042.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Setites"
 PODthorns.0042.desc:0 "Politely declining the Camarilla's half hearted offer, the Setite representative has done what everyone thought the most likely outcome : confirmed his clan's neutrality in the ongoing struggle."
 PODthorns.0043.t:0 "Thorns : The Assamite"
 PODthorns.0043.desc:0 "As the Ottoman's expansion threatens Europe, the nascent Camarilla is divided on how to handle it. The Assamite have been very active in the shadow of the Turks, and the Convention of Thorns will be an opportunity for both sides to at least try to work out their differences."
 PODthorns.0044.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Assamite"
 PODthorns.0044.desc:0 "In a surprising display of diplomacy from both factions, the Assamites and the Camarilla have come to a groundbreaking arrangement, bringing the Children of Haqim firmly in the new sect. A new era of relations between east and west is opening."
 PODthorns.0045.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Assamite"
 PODthorns.0045.desc:0 "The talks have broken down between the Camarilla and the Assamites. It seems the whole Convention has made things even worse, as the Children of Haqim have pledged their help to the Anarch movement, hoping to shatter the old, and new, order of European Cainites."
 PODthorns.0046.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Assamite"
 PODthorns.0046.desc:0 "As the Assamite representative leaves the Convention, nothing much has changed. The tenuous neutrality of the Children of Haqim in the affairs of Western Cainites continues."
 PODthorns.0047.t:0 "Thorns : The Cappadocian"
 PODthorns.0047.desc:0 "The Clan of Death has always been divided, and has endured many purges and restructuring. Still, it has always been a respected clan and, despite their reclusive habits, has henceforth received a formal invitation to join the Camarilla."
 PODthorns.0048.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Cappadocian"
 PODthorns.0048.desc:0 "After a long discussion, it seems that the Camarilla and the Clan of Death have come to an agreement. The nascent sect has one more member, and is already congratulating itself for this achievement."
 PODthorns.0049.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Cappadocian"
 PODthorns.0049.desc:0 "Although nobody is quite sure of what exactly happened, the talks between the Camarilla and the Clan of Death have completely backfired. Feeling themselves insulted and mistreated, they have chosen to join forces with the Anarch movement, which is quite surprised at this sudden support."
 PODthorns.0050.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Cappadocian"
 PODthorns.0050.desc:0 "As most people in the Convention expected, the Clan of Death has declared his neutrality in the ongoing conflict. They will stay this mysterious and reclusive group of scholars they have always been."
 PODthorns.0051.t:0 "Thorns : The Salubri"
 PODthorns.0051.desc:0 "Despite their many foes, the Salubri are still a force to be reckoned with. They have endured to this night and were obviously invited to the Convention. Most expect them to take the opposite side of the hated clan Tremere, but neutrality is also a strong possibility, as unending warfare has cost them dearly already."
 PODthorns.0052.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Salubri"
 PODthorns.0052.desc:0 "The Camarilla congratulates itself as the Salubri officially joins them. They have already pledged to help curb the campaign of disinformation going on about their new allies, and restore them to their true place as the clan of Healers."
 PODthorns.0053.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Salubri"
 PODthorns.0053.desc:0 "Retribution is the name of the moment for clan Salubri. They want payback for all the horrors they endured, and they found new allies in the Anarch Movement. Perhaps their common suffering brought them together."
 PODthorns.0054.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Salubri"
 PODthorns.0054.desc:0 "Their fight for survival has cost clan Salubri a lot. It is time for them to heal, soul and body alike. With these words, their representative confirms the clan's neutrality in the ongoing crisis."
 PODthorns.0055.t:0 "Thorns : The Ravnos"
 PODthorns.0055.desc:0 "The Ravnos have always been outsiders to Western Cainites, but this state of affairs is rapidly changing as the Indian clan is more and more present in Europe. As a nod to this newfound strength, they have been invited to the Convention, even though most people think they will stick to a cautious neutrality in the ongoing war."
 PODthorns.0056.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Ravnos"
 PODthorns.0056.desc:0 "In a momentous occasion, the Ravnos are making their most pivotal move in Europe as of now : they have decided to join the nascent Camarilla. A cautious optimism is being felt by the sect at the announcement of this alliance."
 PODthorns.0057.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Ravnos"
 PODthorns.0057.desc:0 "To everyone surprise, Clan Ravnos has sided with the Anarch Movement. Is that the consequence of the poor treatment they received from Western Princes when first coming into Europe? Few can answer, but the Anarchs are welcoming their new brothers with open arms."
 PODthorns.0058.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Ravnos"
 PODthorns.0058.desc:0 "As most people expected, the Ravnos have confirmed their neutrality in the war between elders and neonates. The Indian clan is playing the long game, and is still in the arduous process of getting accepted in these far away lands."
 PODthorns.0059.t:0 "Thorns : The Caitiff"
 PODthorns.0059.desc:0 "The Caitiff were a mere rumor two centuries ago, and hunted to death if they ever showed up in a city. But times have changed, and they can't be ignored anymore. They have invited themselves to the Convention and are expected to help the Anarch Movement, who shares many of their grievances."
 PODthorns.0060.t:0 "Thorns : Camarilla Caitiff"
 PODthorns.0060.desc:0 "Shocking development at the Convention as the Caitiff have joined the Camarilla. After many debates, and changes to the proposed official constitution of the sect, the two factions have come to an accord. A new dawn shines for the downtrodden of the Cainite race."
 PODthorns.0061.t:0 "Thorns : Opposition Caitiff"
 PODthorns.0061.desc:0 "The Anarch Movement finds itself bolstered with the allegiance of the Caitiff. It is not really a surprise, as they share mostly the same grievances and foes, but still a powerful boon to the neonates' cause."
 PODthorns.0062.t:0 "Thorns : Neutral Caitiff"
 PODthorns.0062.desc:0 "The Caitiff have chosen a prudent course of action at the Convention. Despite their misgivings with the Camarilla, they are trying to not antagonize it further by announcing their neutrality."
 PODthorns.0063.t:0 "Thorns : the End"
 PODthorns.0063.desc:0 "As the last representatives leave the convention area, everyone is already planning their next move. The Camarilla has yet to achieve its planned total supremacy over the Kindred race. The Opposition is talking about reforming the Anarch Movement into a brand new organization to counter the Camarilla. Finally, the neutrals are preparing pacts and alliances to ensure their survival. An new age of Cainite history begins, with an uncertain future ahead."
 PODthorns.0063.a:0 "What will the next move of the Great Game be?"
