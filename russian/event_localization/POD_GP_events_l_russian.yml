 podgreatpersons.0001.t:0 "Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi"
 podgreatpersons.0001.desc:0 "A renowned historian and philosopher, Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi has recently moved back to Baghdad after years of extensive travels across the Middle East. His writings and knowledge of the soul, mind and body of humans are already being held in great value, and even Saladin himself gave him patronage. As he grows older and more reclusive, it might be your only chance of acquiring such a fine childe for yourself."
 podgreatpersons.0001.a:0 "Gold is of no concern."
 podgreatpersons.0001.b:0 "It is time to pull some strings."
 podgreatpersons.0001.c:0 "We are better off without another competitor."
 podgreatpersons.0001.d:0 "Just give it to me!" 
 podgreatpersons.0001.custom:0 "This Great Person will join your court, giving you a small window to perform the embrace. Messing with such an individual will increase your Masquerade Exposure."
 podgreatpersons.0001.customb:0 "This Great Person will wander around until death comes calling."
 podgreatpersons.0002.t:0 "Alice Kyteler"
 podgreatpersons.0002.desc:0 "A quaint little story has come to your attention. One crafty mortal named Alice Kyteler has recently escaped her trial for witchcraft, heresy, animal sacrifice and fornication with a demon seemingly named 'Robin'. All her associates have either already been burnt at the stake or soon will be, but she managed to thwart the Church on so many occasions that her ability can't be denied. As one of your contacts informs you that she has taken refuge close to your domain, you wonder if you'd fancy having an ambitious and clever witch as a childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0003.t:0 "Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi"
 podgreatpersons.0003.desc:0 "An accomplished jurist and theologian, Rumi as he is more widely known, is made even more famous by his Ghazals, or Persian poems. A widely beloved man, even outside of Muslim communities, he has recently finished his masterpiece, the Masnavi. News is that illness is catching up to him, and that he has predicted his own death. You have a small window to act if you want to embrace him be it for patronizing his future works or for more... Cainitic related endeavors."
 podgreatpersons.0004.t:0 "Agnes Randolph"
 podgreatpersons.0004.desc:0 "As the mortal war for Scottish independence rages on, the name Agnes Dunbar has come to your attention. This fierce Scot has defended her leaderless castle with a spirit as indomitable as any mortal can muster. Turning 20,000 Englishmen in ridicule with clever tricks and a quick wit, the lady of the castle has more than proven her mettle. Stuck in a loveless marriage with few prospects of any inheritance, you could probably convince such a brave woman to put her considerable skills to your service. Perhaps even as a childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0005.t:0 "Agnes Sorel"
 podgreatpersons.0005.desc:0 "You have just been informed that Louis XI, the son of the mortal king of France is planning to poison Agnes Sorel, the Royal Mistress. This often scandalous lady has been a strong influence on the king for a while now and tales of her beauty have even reached your court. If you don't act fast, France will lose one of its most beautiful flowers. If you do however... well, perhaps you can make sure that this specific flower never withers."
 podgreatpersons.0006.t:0 "Alexander Nevsky?"
 podgreatpersons.0006.desc:0 "In a surprising turn of events, you have heard that someone claiming to be Alexander Nevsky has recently shown up in a nearby town. It is unlikely at best, since the famed Grand Prince of Vladimir is currently on a diplomatic mission with the Golden Horde. This individual claims to have learned of Cainite society and wishes to be 'embraced on his own terms' to gain immortality, but not enslavement. You have doubts about this story but can you let a rival potentially embrace the Hero of the Rus, bane of Germans and Swedes alike? At the very least, you can make him come to your court and judge for yourself..."
 podgreatpersons.0007.t:0 "Anthony of Padua?"
 podgreatpersons.0007.desc:0 "One of your agents report that someone claiming to be Anthony of Padua, the famous holy man, has been seen in a nearby town. It is unlikely at best, since you are pretty sure that the real Anthony died last year, and was canonized by Rome. The real Franciscan monk was a living Saint, with an aura capable of burning your kind from miles away. Still... perhaps this is worth investigating. He could be one of his companions still alive or a man learned enough to warrant considering as a potential childe."
 podgreatpersons.0008.t:0 "Antonio de Nebrija"
 podgreatpersons.0008.desc:0 "One of the greatest humanists of the era, Antonio de Nebrija has authored many books that your court often references. You are not particularly keen on this 'humanism' fad that the mortals are having right now but you can't deny the talent of this man. His age is catching up to him though, and you wonder if now would be the right time to bring him closer to your court. Perhaps having a 'modern minded' childe of your own could prove beneficial."
 podgreatpersons.0009.t:0 "Baba Ishak Kafarsurdi"
 podgreatpersons.0009.desc:0 "A mortal has made quite a ruckus in northeastern Anatolia recently. Proclaiming himself an immortal Messiah, this Ishak has gathered many followers and even led open rebellion against the Seljuk Sultanate. As is often the case with mortals though, this was a short lived attempt and the so called 'Immortal' is soon going to be executed. You consider that this man doesn't lack in charisma and drive. Perhaps with the proper teacher, he could make an interesting childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0010.t:0 "Beatriz da Silva?"
 podgreatpersons.0010.desc:0 "Something happened in the palace of Toledo dedicated to the new order of the Immaculate Conception. Reports are hazy, but your agents claim that they finally have been able to approach the place despite the aura of True Faith around it. They followed survivors of what looks like an attack by unknown parties and think they have a good handle on the order foundress-Beatriz da Silva's-location after the event. It seems far fetched, especially since Da Silva must be far too holy for Cainites to approach but still, this is an opportunity. You could track this woman down and bring her to you. You might have a use for her..."
 podgreatpersons.0011.t:0 "Birgitta Birgersdotter?"
 podgreatpersons.0011.desc:0 "Knowing of your reputation, a young woman claiming to be Birgitta Birgersdotter has come to one of your agents asking to be 'freed from the trappings of the Church'. Your men say that there are similarities between this woman and what is known of the holy woman about to found a new holy order in Sweden, but the age doesn't match. With a little digging, you can safely say that this is one of her daughters, Cecilia, who was stuck in a convent against her will at a young age by her saintly mother. Although not as big as a prize as Birgitta herself, Cecilia still looks like a potentially useful and determined young woman. Potentially a suitable candidate for embrace?"
 podgreatpersons.0012.t:0 "Catherine of Siena?"
 podgreatpersons.0012.desc:0 "You have heard of Catherine of Siena, a young holy woman having made a name for herself as a traveling force of God, perhaps the most ardent advocate for the Church of Rome currently active, even if seeming at odds sometimes. As such, you were surprised when another woman surfaced recently, claiming to be the presumed dead sister of Catherine, Bonaventura. It seems she has survived thus far with methods better left unsaid and wishes now to disappear from History, as her 'death' was a profound guiding lesson for Catherine. It is an unusual request, as it seems the woman is still quite fervent in her love for God and her sister, but not enough to take her own life. You ponder your next move."
 podgreatpersons.0013.t:0 "Clare of Assisi?"
 podgreatpersons.0013.desc:0 "A minor rival of yours has made a daring move against San Damiano, the Church where the holy Clare of Assisi is dwelling with her sisters in faith. Obviously, the fool and his cronies didn't survive the True Faith permeating the area, but they managed to cause quite a commotion. It appears that one of Clare's sisters, Beatrix, was 'lost' during the assault. Although you stand no chance against the pious and virtuous Clare herself, embracing her sister would be a moral blow to the Church..."
 podgreatpersons.0014.t:0 "Cesare Borgia"
 podgreatpersons.0014.desc:0 "Cesare Borgia, the ruthless Italian, is currently leading a difficult siege in Viana. The man has proved himself immensely resourceful so far, with many victories, and betrayals, to his name during his campaigns in Italy. With the death of his father Rodrigo and the ascent of a new, hostile Pope, he is starting to get cornered by his many enemies. There would be no better time to make a move if you wish a prestigious childe of your own. After all, anything can happen during a siege..."
 podgreatpersons.0015.t:0 "Christine de Pizan"
 podgreatpersons.0015.desc:0 "A common sight in French courts for decades, the famous writer and teacher Christine du Pizan has recently moved to a convent for the last years of her mortal life. Her work has received high praise in many circles, including Cainite, as they dwell on the true definition of rulership, optimistic views on the future and the place of women in France's history. Her body might be weakening, but her mind seems as sharp as ever, as she has recently published a poem on Joan of Arc's destiny. Some courtiers of yours fancy the idea of making her a part of Cainite society. For safekeeping of her talent, of course."
 podgreatpersons.0016.t:0 "Cola di Rienzo"
 podgreatpersons.0016.desc:0 "Mortal Rome has been in an even greater uproar than usual as of late. The main cause being one Cola di Rienzo, a commoner having managed to become leader of the city by sheer charisma... twice. He dreams of a new Roman Empire, clearly infatuated with his own delusions of grandeur. The man also seems quite meek when it comes to warfare and is easily bullied. Your agents are doubtful if he is really talented or just insanely lucky. The fact is that the Roman mob is clearly turning against him now, an opportunity for you to embrace an unlikely, but perhaps useful, childe."
 podgreatpersons.0017.t:0 "Dante Alighieri"
 podgreatpersons.0017.desc:0 "Although your court and your peers don't understand it, you have become quite fond of a recently published epic called 'the Divine Comedy'. It has... something that reaches deep into your soul, especially in your condition, as if the author knew more than a mortal should about Gods and Demons. This man, Dante Alighieri, is quite down on his luck now, having been exiled and forsaken by most of his old political allies. It is unlikely that anyone would mind if he was to meet some unfortunate accident... And then, you could bring him to your court and have the answers you seek. After all, an immortal life should be enough time to understand the Divine."
 podgreatpersons.0018.t:0 "Diane de Poitiers"
 podgreatpersons.0018.desc:0 "Diane de Poitiers has been the true power behind the throne of France for almost 25 years now. As far as you can tell, she hasn't really plotted or killed her way into this position... which would have made her a perfect embrace candidate. Still, you don't get to be this powerful in France without an astute intellect and a good deal of political sense, both qualities the Royal Favourite have aplenty. With the recent death of Henry II, her main rival, Catherine de Medici, has already moved in to remove all the power and assets given to her by the king. Diane doesn't seem bent on retaliating and appears to accept her fate of falling into obscurity. It could be a good time to secure yourself a chief advisor of your own..."
 podgreatpersons.0019.t:0 "Edward Longshanks?"
 podgreatpersons.0019.desc:0 "The last king of England, Edward I, died four years ago. You followed his life with interest, as he was a renowned lawmaker, shrewd politician and capable general, all qualities prized in Cainite society... with just a touch of fear and brutality of course, also qualities possessed by the late king. Embracing him was always out of the question, as protected by agents of the Church as kings are, but you recently heard that Henry of Lacy, his most trustworthy companion is showing signs of leaving his mortal coil. A loyal and capable man himself, he could make for a good witness of Longshanks' tactics, or even an embrace candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0020.t:0 "Erzsebet Bathory"
 podgreatpersons.0020.desc:0 "One of your agents returned from castle Csejte with a troubling report, it seems that Erzsebet Bathory, the woman accused of more than 600 murders, bathing in the blood of virgins and cannibalism, isn't actually a vampire... yet. Her trial was a merciless affair, even capable of troubling the most resilient Cainite with detailed accounts of her torture practices which include burning, freezing, using live ants or eviscerating. Sometimes all of them at once. But if she isn't a vampire... that means that she would make an excellent, if perhaps a little unhinged, embrace candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0021.t:0 "Elizabeth of Hungary?"
 podgreatpersons.0021.desc:0 "A minor rival of yours recently made a move against Konrad von Marburg, a renowned inquisitor and erstwhile mentor of the recently departed Saint Elizabeth of Hungary. The fool was crushed, but the aftermath is messy, with trails leading to more clues about the 'Cainite Conspiracy'. One of those is a young woman, another pupil of the inquisitor, who witnessed first hand the gifts of Caine. Making her disappear would cause suspicion but could be useful, both as a strike against the Inquisition and as a potential embrace candidate. Strangely enough, the woman is also named Elizabeth and seems close to the age the Saint should be at this point. Perhaps Konrad has secrets of his own..."
 podgreatpersons.0022.t:0 "Ernst von Manfeld"
 podgreatpersons.0022.desc:0 "Your agents report that Ernst von Manfeld, the infamous mercenary leader is currently in Bosnia, apparently in a state of terminal illness. This crafty German has made a name for himself as a skilled, if not overtly reliable, man for hire. He is quite renowned for having fought on the Protestant side during the Thirty Years War... despite considering himself a devout Catholic. With his excellent military pedigree and... open mindedness, he could make for an interesting embrace candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0023.t:0 "Eustace Folville"
 podgreatpersons.0023.desc:0 "The so called 'Folville' gang has been the talk of England for decades now. Probably not much better than mere thugs, these outlaws had the good fortune, or the ability, of targeting members of Edward II's entourage. The king, as despised as he is, can't really convince anyone that Eustace's gang isn't some sort of popular band of heroic figures. After many years of research, your agents have finally tracked down the aging outlaw. You are now able to potentially acquire an able fighter and rabble-rouser for yourself."
 podgreatpersons.0024.t:0 "Fibonacci"
 podgreatpersons.0024.desc:0 "A new fad is coming over the mortals. The 'Hindu-Arabic' numeral system is starting to be used over the older -and obviously superior in your opinion- Roman one. You are pretty sure the mortals will come to their senses in due time but you are curious about the proponent of this theory, one Leonardo Bonacci, also known as Fibonacci. The now old man has settled in Pisa after publishing his treatise. You can't deny the man's knowledge and you could 'invite' him to your court for a debate. Or perhaps for more... familial purposes?"
 podgreatpersons.0025.t:0 "Florian Geyer"
 podgreatpersons.0025.desc:0 "The mortal Peasants' War has been an annoying thorn in your side for some time now as feeding becomes harder to obtain when peasants are dying by the droves in a war. An opportunity has presented itself though in the form of Florian Geyer, the disgraced noble leading the 'Black Company,' a unit of heavy cavalry who fought alongside the peasants. Although already a popular hero to the common people, Geyer is also ruthless and quick to anger making him a loose cannon in the wild. And it so appears that, after their last defeat at Ingolstadt, your agents were able to pinpoint his location. Cornered and on the losing side of History, it's only a matter of time before Geyer faces death. But if you were to intervene..."
 podgreatpersons.0026.t:0 "Galeazzo Maria Sforza"
 podgreatpersons.0026.desc:0 "These last years you have been entertained by the tales of one Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the mortal duke of Milan. A man with vivid imagination, he has created many new forms of torture, both psychological and physical. Your court was particularly amused by the 'nail a man alive to his coffin' one. Obviously, this hasn't really made him many friends in Milan and beyond, and it stands to reason to think he will bsoon be removed from power, probably violently. You are entertaining the idea of staging his death yourself, to then bring him back to your court. At the very least, he could make for a very lively vampire..."
 podgreatpersons.0027.t:0 "Geoffrey Chaucer"
 podgreatpersons.0027.desc:0 "You have heard that the famous poet and civil servant, Geoffrey Chaucer, has been ambushed by bandits and wounded during the attack. The man isn't young anymore and his glory days have passed with his patron Richard II's abdication. Still, he is an able diplomat and a prodigious poet, one of the first using the Middle English language as a literary device. Such a learned person in both politics and poetry warrants a degree of appeal as a prospective childe."
 podgreatpersons.0028.t:0 "Gilles de Rais"
 podgreatpersons.0028.desc:0 "One of Joan of Arc's companions, Gilles de Rais, has fallen quite low recently. Having lost his fortune and any goodwill from his peers, the nobleman seems to have resorted to more... demonic patrons. His trial has been a sordid affair, with testimonies of murders with a degree of cruelty that even most Cainites would find distasteful. The veracity of the accusations are hard to acknowledge since, after all, even mortals plot against each other. It remains that Gilles will face death by hanging very soon... unless you were to intervene and replace him with another poor soul. For a human, Gilles has certainly shown potential as an embrace candidate..."
 podgreatpersons.0029.t:0 "Girolamo Savonarola"
 podgreatpersons.0029.desc:0 "Florence has been in an uproar recently, when one Dominican friar, Savonarola, ousted the ruling Medici by preaching the good people visions of glory, for them, and ruin, for their enemies. This man has proven resilient, resisting excommunication attempts by the Church and even placating the king of France into a pseudo-alliance. His luck has run out as of late though, as he botched the trial by fire meant to prove his divine calling to the people of Florence. Now held in prison by an angry mob and lacking any support, the one time de facto ruler of Florence will face death by fire very soon... unless you were to intervene. Certainly, Savonarola has talent in making people follow him and that is a valuable quality to have in Cainite politics."
 podgreatpersons.0030.t:0 "Gottfried von Berlichingen"
 podgreatpersons.0030.desc:0 "The mercenary leader Gottfried -Gotz- von Berlichingen has became the talk of your court lately. The wrathful and foul mouthed German is known to hold grudges for a very long time and even more famously known for having lost his arm during a siege. A fact that has not stopped Gotz for long, as he promptly used a strange iron device to replace it and go back to the battlefield. After a long career of wars, captures and injuries, the 'Iron Hand' is finally starting to show his age and has returned to his family estate to spend his final days in peace. Your court argues that such a tenacious and experimented individual would be a great asset to your undoubtedly just cause as a ruler of the night."
 podgreatpersons.0031.t:0 "Hadewijch"
 podgreatpersons.0031.desc:0 "Word has reached you of a traveling noblewoman named Hadewijch passing through your city. Although their inquiry didn't reveal much about her past, your agents describe her a skilled poetess and writer with the look of someone who has faced much during her life, but still endures. This strong personality and learned background makes her someone worth watching over, and perhaps even worth considering as an embrace candidate."
 podgreatpersons.0032.t:0 "Hermann von Salza"
 podgreatpersons.0032.desc:0 "The Grandmaster of the Teutonic Order has been a massive headache for the Cainites in Germany since the start of his tenure. Even the Black Cross, the order of German Cainite knights, could not pierce the True Faith shielding this man. As such, and with his impressive talents as both a commander and a diplomat, Hermann has been able to curb most Cainite influence on his order. Something has changed recently though, as the Teutonic knights have enacted a silent rebellion pushing him to the sidelines as a mere figurehead. As old age catches up with him and his life's work crumbles, Hermann's faith is dwindling. This could be the best opportunity for some sweet ironic revenge on this soldier of the Church..."
 podgreatpersons.0033.t:0 "Ibn Arabi"
 podgreatpersons.0033.desc:0 "One of the most famous learned man of the Muslim world has recently moved to Damascus. Ibn Arabi is a renowned scholar, mystic and philosopher with almost 850 works attributed to him. Even the Cainite world has taken notice, with various debates springing up about his true knowledge of the inner workings of the world. Now an old man, it seems Ibn Arabi is frantically trying to finish his second draft of the Futuḥat al-Makkiyya before death catches up to him. Granting the gift of immortality to such an individual is tempting, even if you know that the curse of Cain can profoundly change a person..."
 podgreatpersons.0034.t:0 "Ibn Khaldun"
 podgreatpersons.0034.desc:0 "The renowned scholar, politician and historian Ibn Khaldun is, once again, threatened by his numerous enemies. The old adventurer has experienced a life of schemes, military conquests and many prestigious government positions. Still, he is best known for his remarkable work on the cyclical nature of empires which has made him one of the envoys sent to parlay with the threatening Mongol lord Timur. Having returned recently, his allegiance to a secret political party is coming back to haunt him and his days appear numbered, both by his propensity for trouble and old age. Some of your courtiers urge you to consider him as a potential childe before it is too late."
 podgreatpersons.0035.t:0 "Imperia Cognita"
 podgreatpersons.0035.desc:0 "The 'Queen of Courtesans' has been a welcome sight in Rome since her arrival. A shrewd woman, she managed to claw her way to the top of Rome's most famous celebrities, the courtesans. Adored by both the clergy and artists, such as Raphael, she is a wealthy and influential presence in the Holy City. It seems this is coming to an end though, as she is currently fighting, and losing, a battle against poison apparently self administered. Although you aren't sure why she tried to kill herself, perhaps a petty mortal reason like 'true love', you know that this is an opportunity to embrace one that should easily find her place in the courts of the night."
 podgreatpersons.0036.t:0 "Jan Hus?"
 podgreatpersons.0036.desc:0 "The 'Hussite movement' has been a major concern for Cainites recently. Some are enthralled at the idea of the Church falling into pieces, others seem genuinely interested in this reformist theory. The head of the movement, Jan Hus himself, isn't long for the world though, as his trial will very likely result in his prompt execution. One group of young 'Hussite' Cainites has mounted a daring rescue of the prisoner... and failed miserably. In the aftermath though, your agents took notice of a lone man wandering the streets, claiming to be the preacher himself. It is very unlikely, as the trial is continuing smoothly, but he might be a disciple of Hus, shocked by the attack. In any case, as a survivor of a Cainite assault, he is a threat to your continued secrecy..."
 podgreatpersons.0037.t:0 "Jan Zizka"
 podgreatpersons.0037.desc:0 "You have been closely following the career of one brilliant general named Jan Zizka. This Hussite leader has proven immensely capable, turning a ragtag band of peasants into a force capable of defeating Europe's best knights using innovative tactics. Most notably with the advent of what is known as 'gunpowder', a deadly new weapon that could cause issues for your kind. You have learned that Zizka is once again on campaign, but the plague has caught up to him, and his days seem numbered. You strongly consider mounting an operation to bring him to your court as he would be a valued military leader and someone who could explain to you first hand the danger of these new weapons."
 podgreatpersons.0038.t:0 "Madame de Pompadour"
 podgreatpersons.0038.desc:0 "France has a long tradition of powerful mistresses and confidantes for her kings. But you must admit that what you have been told of Jeanne Antoinette Poisson is out of the ordinary. The royal mistress, then 'friend of the king' when they moved on to a more chaste relationship, has had as much power as Louis XV in recent years, if not more. Her charisma, political acumen and solid network of friends has made her powerful... and hated in many circles of the court. This is coming to an end though, as her frail constitution has finally won over her resolve, with a disease she probably won't survive. Mortal France will lose a jewel, but perhaps Cainite France could win one..."
 podgreatpersons.0039.t:0 "Jeanne de Clisson"
 podgreatpersons.0039.desc:0 "Your agents inform you that the infamous 'Lioness of Brittany' and her children have recently shipwrecked in a remote area. The Lioness is Jeanne de Clisson, a Breton noblewoman who has sworn revenge on the French king for the cowardly execution of her husband more than 10 years ago. Since then, she has been privateering with surprising success against the French fleets near Brittany. A willful and practical woman, she is known to leave only one survivor each time to tell the tale, she has impressed many of your courtiers. Her recent defeat and isolation from her allies and crewmates gives you an opportunity to 'invite' her to your court. Perhaps you could use such a Lioness as a childe..."
 podgreatpersons.0040.t:0 "Jeanne d'Arc?"
 podgreatpersons.0040.desc:0 "The 'Maid of Orleans' has been a major issue for Cainites as the war rages on between France and England. What was a major opportunity for easy scheming and easier feeding has turned into an almost religious war. True Faith runs rampant, and you have lost count of the number of Cainites burned by the zealots flocking to Jeanne's banner. She is herself unassailable, protected by a conviction that looks divine in nature but... her close relatives aren't. It is petty but you could take revenge on her family for all the headache she's caused, especially as the English have finally caught her, rendering her, hopefully, harmless. And with a little luck, they could even make useful pawns."
 podgreatpersons.0041.t:0 "John Cabot"
 podgreatpersons.0041.desc:0 "This is a time of change and exploration, two things that Cainites aren't suited to handle. As Europe launches more and more expeditions into the great unknown, your kind wonders what manner of horrors, and opportunities, await them. You are determined to not be left behind and, as such, have made inquiries about one of the greatest explorers of the age, John Cabot. This stalwart ship captain has recently came back from one of his many trips to the great west and could probably do many more with an immortal patron such as yourself. Granting him immortality is also an option, one that could give you quite a headstart on the future, both here and beyond the vast blue ocean."
 podgreatpersons.0042.t:0 "John Hawkwood"
 podgreatpersons.0042.desc:0 "The Condottieri are a fact of life in Italy. These men are payed to wage war for the rich city states of the country and are often as fickle in allegiance as they are greedy for coins. One of their leaders, the English John Hawkwood, has made most of his career here, fighting for and against many cities. A ruthless and greedy man by most accounts, he is also acclaimed as one of the best commanders and strategists of the lot. As his age is catching up to him, and what should be his last expedition done, some of your courtiers argue that this would be a good time to approach him. The promise of immortality would easily seduce such a man and he could prove useful... if you could bind him to your will."
 podgreatpersons.0043.t:0 "Leonardo da Vinci"
 podgreatpersons.0043.desc:0 "For some time now, Francis I has grown quite fond of an Italian artist, even going as far as giving him a castle for his personal use. You have spied on the man and must acknowledge the sheer genius in multiple fields he possesses. You are far from the only one admiring him though, with what looks like a cabal of willworkers keeping close watch, making any close contact impossible. Recently though, you have learned that Leonardo's health is failing, pushing the king to schedule a visit to his old friend. This might be your best chance at 'inviting' the greatest mind of this generation to your court..."
 podgreatpersons.0044.t:0 "Lucrezia Borgia"
 podgreatpersons.0044.desc:0 "You are always on the lookout for potential embrace candidates, and the Borgia family has no shortage of those. Lucrezia, daughter of Pope Alexander VI, has been quite an asset for her father and brother. Fair, intelligent and strong willed, she is the perfect Renaissance princess. The rumors of poisoning and ruthless intrigue surrounding her are a plus in your book, since it would make her even more suited for undeath. Your agents are awaiting your word."
 podgreatpersons.0045.t:0 "Marco Polo"
 podgreatpersons.0045.desc:0 "The Cainite world is large and you are always keen on learning more about what strange friends, or most likely foes, you could make abroad. An opportunity has arisen with one Venetian merchant named Marco Polo. Allegedly, the man who is having a quiet family life right now has traveled as far as Cathay for several decades. It is likely that he has picked up some interesting information or clues about the night world abroad during this time. Obviously, you could just read his notes, but you could also do far better than that... Your agents are ready to make a visit to the Polo estate at your command."
 podgreatpersons.0046.t:0 "Margaret I"
 podgreatpersons.0046.desc:0 "For almost 20 years now, Burgundy and Flanders have been ruled by Margaret Capet. The early death of her husband, and her strong influence on her child have made her a force to be reckoned with in the area. Strong willed, she isn't the kindest of rulers, as can attest the numerous rebellions that have risen, and been crushed, during her reign. Still, she is a capable stateswoman with a mind capable of enduring the rigors of undeath and, as such, you are considering a daring operation to embrace her before death claims her."
 podgreatpersons.0047.t:0 "Michael Scot"
 podgreatpersons.0047.desc:0 "The science adviser and court astrologer of Emperor Frederick II is a strange Englishman named Michael Scot. This evidently learned individual is often accused of black magic since he seems to know more about the inner workings of the world that anyone should. As far as you can tell though, he is not possessed by any supernatural force... yet. His knowledge of Heaven and God is of special interest to you, a being cursed by the Creator himself, and you wonder if Scot could be an asset in this endeavor. Separating him from the Emperor's court and faking his death as an accident wouldn't be easy, but it is in your power."
 podgreatpersons.0048.t:0 "Mindaugas"
 podgreatpersons.0048.desc:0 "Mortal Lithuania is slowly converting to Christianity, as many eastern countries have done before. Here, the process is bloody and unforgiving though, with the native religions fighting against the holy orders. A turning point has perhaps been reached with the crowning of Mindaugas, the first king of Lithuania, with his baptism into the Church. Far from a zealot though, he has already changed religions several times as he battled the Tatars and rival dukes for the crown. While no doubt cynical, Mindaugas has accomplished much militarily and administratively and so, when you learn of a mortal plot to kill him for petty revenge, you consider your options. Embracing a king is always risky, but his power base is weak enough that you could be successful."
 podgreatpersons.0049.t:0 "Niccolo Machiavelli"
 podgreatpersons.0049.desc:0 "You have been fascinated by a manuscript recently gifted to you. 'The Prince' is a perfect study of Cainite politics and rulership... and it was written by a mere mortal! This Machiavelli is far from receiving the fame you think he deserves, with his masterpiece being torn apart over petty concerns of 'morality' and 'just rule'. If mortals can't appreciate the genius behind this work, you could certainly offer him a better deal. An immortality deal..."
 podgreatpersons.0050.t:0 "Nicolaas Zannekin"
 podgreatpersons.0050.desc:0 "Flanders has been plagued by peasant revolts for several years now. It is certainly an opportunity for Cainites since, after all, feeding is much easier during times of war. This specific revolt is strangely enduring, as far as mortal feuds go, and surprisingly successful with the capture of several towns and the count himself. You have no doubt that it will be crushed in time but... this endurance is the sign of a good leader ordering the peasants around. Perhaps you could have some agents of yours 'inquire' about the rebel leader during the next battle..."
 podgreatpersons.0051.t:0 "Nikephoros Blemmydes"
 podgreatpersons.0051.desc:0 "The fall of Constantinople has seen the loss of many great scholars. Some, though, have been able to thrive in the chaotic aftermath, like Nikephoros Blemmydes. A teacher, writer and theologian, he has taken residence in Nikaea where the emperor offers him ample patronage. He has already taught many great figures, such as the prince, and is considering retiring to live his later life in the serene peace of a monastery. Such beacons of late Roman culture are becoming increasingly rare as the fortune of the empire dwindles. As such, you are considering gifting him immortality, to preserve that one small piece of it at least."
 podgreatpersons.0052.t:0 "Pons de Capduelh"
 podgreatpersons.0052.desc:0 "The Crusades have been a terrible blow to the region you rule, but they have the advantage of bringing to you some interesting people. One Pons de Capduelh for example, a troubadour from Auvergne, has been the talk of your court for a while. A charming, optimistic fellow with a quick wit and quicker word, seems capable of enthralling even the most stern crusader in bold songs of love and chivalry. Such talent could certainly have its use in Cainite politics, where a silver tongue can get you very far."
 podgreatpersons.0053.t:0 "Rodrigo Borgia"
 podgreatpersons.0053.desc:0 "The Papacy has always been a headache for vampires, the sheer power of the True Faith radiating from it making any inroads impossible. This has changed somewhat with the current Pope, Alexander VI, who seems much more preoccupied by earthly matters than any temporal concerns. He has been quite successful at it too, extending the Papal States' area of influence and the power of his family through conquests and shrewd diplomacy. His less than stellar spirituality allows you a once in a immortal lifetime opportunity : You could send agents into the Holy See itself to 'save' Rodrigo Borgia, currently bedridden by a food intoxication, or poisoning. Then, once hidden in your court, you would have a Pope all to yourself..."
 podgreatpersons.0054.t:0 "Roi Xordo"
 podgreatpersons.0054.desc:0 "Galicia is a country in itself despite being ruled by the King of Castille. This isolated region is home to very autocratic rulers, even by the standards of the era. These nobles are often careless with the common populace and a boiling point was reached four years ago, with a revolt starting. The rebels are led by a minor Fidalgo -a lesser title of nobility- named Roi Xordo. The man has claimed some early successes but the wind is turning, as the more experienced troops of the nobility are cracking down hard on the rebellion. Although they seem doomed to fail, perhaps their leader could still be of some use to you. A passionate and militarily minded childe has its appeal..."
 podgreatpersons.0055.t:0 "Skanderbeg"
 podgreatpersons.0055.desc:0 "The Ottomans have been a major concern for Europe for a while now. The defeated crusade of Varna and the fall of Constantinople paved the way for further expansion on their part. But, for almost 25 years now, they have been thwarted by a man named Skanderbeg, who, with a paltry number of troops, has managed to halt the powerful Turk war machine. Already hailed as a hero across Europe, the elderly general is once again at the helm of a new coalition but a deadly illness has taken hold of him. With no hope of recovery, you are wondering if this would be a good time to 'save' him and bring him to your court. After all, it would be a shame to lose such a brilliant defender."
 podgreatpersons.0056.t:0 "Snorri Sturluson"
 podgreatpersons.0056.desc:0 "Iceland is a remote land, even for other Scandinavians, but it has come to your attention with the tale of one Snorri Sturluson, apparently the most powerful politician of the island. A scholar of Norse mythology, Snorri has navigated chaotic Icelandic and Norwegian politics for decades now but it seems that the King of Norway has had enough. One of your agents reports that an assassination plot is underway targeting the Icelandic lawmaker. It's of little concern to you, of course, but there is the option of saving Snorri and bringing him back to your court if you wish. He could make for an interesting candidate for the embrace."
 podgreatpersons.0057.t:0 "Subutai"
 podgreatpersons.0057.desc:0 "The Mongol Horde has washed away all its enemies from China to Poland. Politically, Gengis Khan is certainly the main factor but militarily, Subutai, his main strategist, is the man behind the scenes. Having orchestrated more than 20 campaigns and won 65 battles, the loyal general is already famous throughout the Steppes. At the ripe age of 72, Subutai has finally decided to retire from the battlefield, offering you a golden opportunity to embrace him without the prying eyes of a whole army."
 podgreatpersons.0058.t:0 "Teresa of Avila?"
 podgreatpersons.0058.desc:0 "Iberia has become quite uncomfortable for Vampires since the beginning of the Spanish Inquisition. You have tried many big and small schemes to reduce the Church influence and it was working quite well until Teresa of Avila came around. This stubborn nun has almost single handedly reformed and reignited the passion for Christianity in the mortal hearts of Iberia. You have put many obstacles in her way, including your agents in the Inquisition and the Church, to no avail. For now, you are letting the matter go and covering your tracks. The last step to do so is 'taking care' of your pet Papal Legate, Egidio Cajal, who has been fleeing your rage since his failure to stop her. But nobody escapes your reach for very long..."
 podgreatpersons.0059.t:0 "Theodore Metochites"
 podgreatpersons.0059.desc:0 "Roman politics are fickle and a man's fortune can easily turn. One such man is Theodore Metochites, the favorite of the late Emperor Andronikos II. A scholar, patron of the arts and renowned diplomat, Theodore owed most of his career to his personal talent, but also his friendship with the right people. When Andronikos was ousted from power, Metochites lost all credit at court and is now secluded in a monastery to live out the rest of his life. Some of your courtiers think that end is a criminal waste of a talented man, and you could intervene, perhaps recuperating a grateful prospective childe in the process."
 podgreatpersons.0060.t:0 "Theodora Palaiologina"
 podgreatpersons.0060.desc:0 "Constantinople has been reconquered by the Roman remnants after nearly 60 years of Latin rule. A period of arduous restoration is underway, heralded by the Empress herself, Theodora Palaiologina. A steadfast matriarch of the renewed Imperial family, she has weathered many political and religious storms. Her husband's early death left her in a position of relative power which she used to usher wise patronage and architectural works. She is a powerful symbol of the Greeks' return to power and you know that many of your rivals want to interfere with her. If you wish to act to have this symbol all for yourself, the time is now."
 podgreatpersons.0061.t:0 "Theodor von Neuhoff"
 podgreatpersons.0061.desc:0 "A colorful character has recently arrived in Zutphen. This man, Theodor von Neuhoff, is crippled by debts which he recovered from by selling his title as... King of Corsica. Indeed, following a short lived rebellion on the Genoese island, the inhabitants have 'crowned' this German adventurer as their prospective King. A tenure he only had for a couple of months before his 'Kingdom' broke into pieces. And now, here he is, not much more than a colorful conman having lost everything. At the very least though, he makes for a good tale. There have been worse prospective childer than one who could amuse you."
 podgreatpersons.0062.t:0 "Thibaut de Navarre"
 podgreatpersons.0062.desc:0 "Few individuals better represent the knightly ideals than Thibaut de Navarre does. He has lived through deadly intrigues (and orchestrated some), gone on a successful crusade, loved a forbidden woman (a Queen no less) and written many songs as a beloved 'Trouvere'. All the while, he also managed to climb the feudal hierarchy from Count of Champagne to King of Navarre where he had a successful reign. You have recently learned that, on the return from a trip to Champagne, Thibault has fallen gravely ill and his escort has slowed down. This might be an unique opportunity for your agents to 'save' the dying King and bring him to your court. An accomplished man such as himself is an interesting candidate for embrace."
 podgreatpersons.0063.t:0 "Thomas Aquinas?"
 podgreatpersons.0063.desc:0 "One of your minor rivals has launched a reckless attack against a manor in Aquino. You are not entirely sure why, it seems that he had pawns in the family there, and that they have been thoroughly cleansed by one member of the household named Thomas. This learned man wants to join the Dominican Order and seems blessed by a superb intellect, already working on many new ideas for the Church. In any case, his True Faith burned your rival to a crisp and you are now left with a mess to contend with, since there have been many witnesses. Thomas himself is unassailable, but you could start by making his mother 'disappear'. Your agents think that the woman is actually a potential embrace candidate, having used some underhanded tactics to achieve her goals in the past."
 podgreatpersons.0064.t:0 "Thomas Muntzer"
 podgreatpersons.0064.desc:0 "The Reformation is in full swing and if, as first, it appeared as a good thing for Vampires with the weakening of the Church, there are now even more Holy Men than ever before running around. Any efforts on your part to squash them have been inconclusive at best. One preacher named Thomas Muntzer is particularly giving you trouble with his creation of an 'Eternal league of God', mostly a growing number of rebellious peasants. His zealous talk of a coming Apocalypse is getting on your nerves and you are considering sending some of your agents during his next battle to bring him to your court. Then, you can show him the true face of Hell..."
 podgreatpersons.0065.t:0 "Timur?"
 podgreatpersons.0065.desc:0 "The Warlord known as Timur has been a major problem for you since he started his ruthless path of conquests. A self proclaimed inheritor of Gengis Khan's legacy, nobody has been able to stand in his way so far and his wars have resulted in countless cities pillaged and burned, which isn't really a good thing for a Vampire's hunting grounds. As Cainite refugees start to cause trouble in your court, you consider a possible solution. So far, any attempts to capture or kill him have failed, as if he were protected by some supernatural force. An alternative course of action would be to abduct his favorite wife and closest advisor. With some luck, it could stall him a little. Worst case scenario, she is known to be talented and beautiful, two interesting qualities for a potential embrace."
 podgreatpersons.0066.t:0 "Tomas de Torquemada"
 podgreatpersons.0066.desc:0 "The Inquisition has already been in full swing for quite some time in the world of the night. But, recently, it has gathered enough support to propagate itself in the mortal realm, with the Spanish Inquisition being officially recognized by the Pope. This has made the unlife of Cainites in Iberia even harder and your subjects belittle you for not 'doing enough'. The Inquisition is way too powerful to take down now, but a surgical strike against its leader, Tomas de Torquemada, could be a moral victory you could capitalize on. Even more so if you could somehow embrace him..."
 podgreatpersons.0067.t:0 "Ulrich von Liechtenstein"
 podgreatpersons.0067.desc:0 "A new fad is coming over these fickle mortals, 'Courtly Love' with tales of knights in shining armor and chaste romance with married ladies. As all things related to mortals, this will not survive the test of time but until then... it is always good to understand their current fancy. Your agents recommend the help of one Ulrich von Liechtenstein, a roaming knight and poet of some renown known as an exemplar of knighthood. The man has a silver tongue and a solid sword arm and could be useful to you in more ways than one."
 podgreatpersons.0068.t:0 "Vasco da Gama"
 podgreatpersons.0068.desc:0 "Contacts with Europe are increasing as of late, with the travels of one Portuguese explorer named Vasco da Gama. Although the man speaks of rich trade and grand alliances, his actions say otherwise. He has butchered the civilians of a traveling Muslim ship, and avenged himself with a full armada against a supposed slight by the King of Zamorin. It is clear now that the Portuguese are coming with a conqueror mindset and must be taught a lesson. Capturing and embracing the ruthless 'Viceroy of India' would serve as a warning to any European Cainites trying to encroach upon your homeland."
 podgreatpersons.0069.t:0 "Wat Tyler"
 podgreatpersons.0069.desc:0 "There is an aura of anticipation about the result of the meeting between King Richard II and Wat Tyler, both hosting a peace conference of sorts between the nobles and the peasants' revolt. Tyler has been the most stubborn of the rebel leaders, refusing any concession made by the King so far. You are pretty sure that many important Cainite figures are gathering in the shadows of the meeting, especially around Tyler's lover, one Patricia of Bollingbroke. As such, you are keen to send some of your own agents on site, to make sure you don't fall behind your rivals' schemes. The only thing left is the question of the freedom of action of your agents. Will you send them with resources and money enough to catch a 'prize' from the event, or just ordering them to watch?"
 podgreatpersons.0070.t:0 "William Wallace"
 podgreatpersons.0070.desc:0 "As the war for Scottish independence rages on, the Scots have lost one of their main commanders. William Wallace had fallen from favor after his defeat at Falkirk, but still remained one of the 'Guardians of Scotland' and a powerful symbol for his people. Elusive since Falkirk, Wallace has been seen traveling around Europe gathering support for his cause until his return to England, where he was recently captured. A trial has started, one where the verdict won't surprise anyone. The Scots will probably endure and rally behind their martyr but it would be a shame to lose such a determined man. You could pull some strings and arrange for a replacement before his execution. Then, he would be all yours..."
 podgreatpersons.0071.t:0 "Nagash"
 podgreatpersons.0071.desc:0 "A deranged old man has been making a fuss around Egypt lately. This individual claims to be the 'First Immortal' and Emperor of 'Nehekhara'. He tells that one of his spells has gone horribly wrong and landed him in 'our world'. The strange thing is, he knows about Vampires, even if he has some curious misconceptions about them (he is adamant that there are only 5 'bloodlines'). In any case, he is a liability, as he clearly is full of himself and could bring some unwanted attention on us. As such, you could send some of your agents to bring him to your court and deal with him yourself."
