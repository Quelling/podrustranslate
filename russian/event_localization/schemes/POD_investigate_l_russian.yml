 POD_investigate.1.t.camilla:0 "Lore: Camilla"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.camilla:0 "Perhaps the most influential Ventrue of history, Titus Venturus Camille was a promising young Roman tutored by the best teachers, be they Collat, his future sire and Prince of Rome, or Lysander and Artemis Orthia of Sparta. A strong sense of rulership and a devoring ambition were soon born, and Camilla took his Sire's throne, some say by diablerie. He will then rule Rome from the Republican era to the Imperial one, pioneering the Eternal Senate and the concept of Masquerade. It is also his command that took down the city of Carthage, earning him the enmity of Brujah for all eternity.\n Even more famously, Camilla would fall in with the burgeoning Road of Sin and become one of its more... skillful adepts. Despite his carefree and sometimes indolent attitude, Camilla managed to keep the reins of power over most of the Cainite world for a millenia, a feat never seen before or after. \n He felt into torpor at the end of the Roman Imperial era, and every semblance of unity in the Cainite world fell with him. He finally awakens in 1230 and easily slips back into power in Rome. But the world has changed much, and it is unlikely that the Prince of Sin will be able to once again rule over Europe. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camilla will fall into torpor during the Medieval era, only to rise in the early 21th century. An old foe will await his return to avenge a grudge as old as Rome itself."
 POD_investigate.1.t.mithras:0 "Lore: Mithras"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.mithras:0 "Once a soldier in the first days of Persia, Mithras has made quite a legacy for himself. Using his powers and incontestable skills at manipulation and persuasion, he soon created a new backstory, that of the Sun God of the same name. This allowed him to be one of the most powerful Ventrue of the ancient world, especially when his cult spreads to Imperial Rome. \n But Christianity and his many rivals got the better of him, and he fled with his following to the frontiers of the Empire, in Britain. The pettiness of the place quickly bore him and he felt into a cycle of torpor, awakening to find everything in shambles due to incompetent regents, fixing it, and then torpor again. \n The last cycle was after 1066, when ambitious Norman Vampires ousted his power base from the island, forcing him to awaken once more and deal with it. As of 1230, the Sun God is once again annoyed by Britain and his influence is strong enough that he could consider another retreat into the sleep of ages. Though it is said that the upstart Hardestadt, claiming overlordship over Clan Ventrue, is angering his much older clanmate. This could be reason enough for him to stay a little while longer... \n Future fate in Canon \n Mithras will stay awake for some time, being a thorn on the side of Hardestadt during the Camarilla's foundation. He felt into torpor once more, to finally be killed in 1996 when Valerius, one of his former regents, betrays him. Though, some spoke of a contingency plan..."
 POD_investigate.1.t.leeland:0 "Lore: Robin Leeland"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.leeland:0 "Not much is known about Robin's early days, except for the theory that he is the legendary folklore figure known as Robin Hood. His actions certainly allude to this, as he is probably the most well known Furores of the Cainite world. \n Always rebelling and fighting against tyrants, he has gathered quite a following for himself and is even considered a worthy foe by Mithras, the Sun God of England. \n Future fate in Canon \n Leeland will never stop fighting the good fight. Becoming a father figure for the most influential Anarchs of history, such as Tyler, Jeremy MacNeil or Marguerite Foccart, he still resides in Nottingham, dispensing wisdom and harassing the miscreants."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.meerlinda:0 "The only woman deemed worthy by Tremere to join his circle of Magus, Meerlinda is the voice of moderation in the Council of Seven. Confidante of Etrius, respected by Goratrix, she has taken part in the original ritual that created the Tremere Clan. Since then, her efforts to find new allies for her beleaguered clan have been tireless. \n Mithras, the Sun God of England, has been reluctant to acknowledge the Tremere, as he is a friend of the Salubri Clan. As such, Meerlinda is quietly gathering followers and influence in the isles, with the goal of ushering a more 'amenable' King to power... \n Future fate in Canon \n Meerlinda will align herself with Hardestadt's Camarilla, securing the power of Clan Tremere for centuries to come. Her reward was the position of Regent of North America, where she is more powerful and influential than ever."
 POD_investigate.1.t.melusine:0 "Lore: Melusine d'Anjou"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.melusine:0 "A proud and somewhat arrogant woman, Melusine was forged in the intrigues of the Angevin Empire. A scion of Clan Toreador, she worked the politics of France with reckless abandon, earning her the enmity of her sister in blood Isouda and a one way trip to exile. \n Arriving in England, she hasn't changed much, styling herself as the main opposition of an amused Mithras and narrating grand tales of her past as the 'Fay of Lusignan'. Her cold and callous temper hasn't win her any friends either. \n Future fate in Canon \n Unsurprisingly, Melusine won't achieve much of significance, and is soon forgotten by History."
 POD_investigate.1.t.johnofyork:0 "Lore: John of York"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.johnofyork:0 "An ambitious Baron born just after the Norman conquest of England, John has proved well suited for Cainite politics. Betraying his sire at an opportune time, he was also quick to pledge his allegiance to Mithras when the Sun God reappeared. His rule over York needs his attention, as the remnants of the Einherjar Vikings are still barely subdued. John hasn't forgotten his freedom from before though, and is one of the main conspirators against the Persian Methuselah's rule. As such, he has gathered a circle of like minded vassals, including Melusine d'Anjou and Meerlinda, patiently waiting for Mithras to make a mistake. \n Future fate in Canon \n John's trust in Meerlinda will prove his undoing."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.magda:0 "One of the rare and mysterious Lhiannan, Magda is a terrible force of nature, a manifestation of Ireland's ancient traditions. She fought against the Romans, the Christians, the Vikings, the Normans... and still fight to this day, being one of the main reasons why Ireland hasn't yet come to fell into Mithras' hands. \n Her lust for battle borders on the insane and has alienated her from any friend or ally, making her more of a beast than the druidic priestess she once was. \n Future fate in Canon \n Some weak rumors have it that Magda finally succumbed to the Beast, and was put down by Werewolves. Others think that she still prowl Ireland, the last relic of a bygone era."

Despite the help of his loyal and handpicked shieldmates, the Brujah wasn't able to turn the tide in Norway, and had to flee. Stranded with others like minded warriors in northern Scotland, Bjorn is preparing for yet another doomed fight of survival for his dying religion. \n Future fate in Canon \n Bjorn will lose once again, and flee for Vinland.

 POD_investigate.1.desc.marcus:0 "A Roman legionary in life, Marcus was already a devout Mithraic before he even met his deity. Being embraced by Mithras himself was a true awakening for Marcus, who then dedicated his unlife to the Sun God he so cherished. Since then, he has been the pillar of Mithras' will in England, maintaining the cult during the Methuselah's absence and hunting any dissidence to the rule of his Sire and God. Still a military man before all, Marcus is more often seen on the battlefield than in courts or temples, leading the Mithraic faithful to victory. \n Future fate in Canon \n The Roman will suffer a major crisis of faith and will then walk a darker path."
 POD_investigate.1.t.camden:0 "Lore: Roger de Camden"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.camden:0 "Born as Rowan in a small English village, Lord Camden always had a special link with the dead. As soothsayer of his town, he attracted the attention of Constancia, one of the most influential Cappadocian, and became her apprentice. They traveled through Europe, and the neonate proved an astute student, eager to learn everything he could about the soul and its interactions with the body, both of the living and the dead. \n When he learned of Mithras' return from torpor, Camden moved to England and has begun to cement a strong bond with the Persian Sun God. \n Future fate in Canon \n Camden will become the Seneschal, main leader of the cult and even lover of Mithras. Faking his death during the Giovanni purge, the scholar will preserve Mithras' legacy, and soul, for centuries."
 POD_investigate.1.t.siegfried:0 "Lore: Siegfried"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.siegfried:0 "A Visigoth chieftain in life, Siegfried caught the eye of a Roman Vampire with his wits and quick intellect. The Ventrue neonate barely survived the harrowing experience and lashed out on his sire, diablerizing him in the process. For this crime, he was hunted for centuries by the all powerful Roman Ventrue before being formally acknowledged in the clan. \n Wary of politics, Siegfried took to wandering the land until he met Hrothulf, another Ventrue of Germanic stock. On his insistence, he took to visit England, the land of another old enemy of Roman Ventrue. \n Future fate in Canon \n Siegfried will flee England after protecting a young neonate.

 POD_investigate.1.desc.salianna:0 "A vestal in life, Salianna's piety and innocence caught the eye of Michael, the Godhood obsessed Toreador. She didn't take it well, and easily saw under the disguise of her monstrous sire. Fleeing Constantinople, she wandered around the Middle-East for some time, until another incident forced her to flee farther west, to nascent France. \n There, she rebuilt her influence and soon become the main alternative from Alexander, the tyrannical Ventrue ruler. The cold war between those two came crashing when Lorraine, Salianna's prized childe, was killed by Alexander in a fit of rage. She then carefully plotted his demise, and managed to achieve it in 1224, with the help of Alexander's childe, Geoffrey du Temple. \n Now, for the first time in her life, Salianna is truly in charge. But wolves are circling around her coveted position, be they the exiled Alexander, the rebelling Esclarmonde or Geoffrey himself. \n Future fate in Canon \n Salianna won't enjoy her victory for long. As France crumbles under the fire of the Inquisition, she is betrayed by her friend Beatrix who takes the throne of France. Her exact final fate remains unknown."
 POD_investigate.1.t.geoffrey:0 "Lore: Geoffrey du Temple"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.geoffrey:0 "A young French knight having participated in the First Crusade, Geoffrey caught the eye of the powerful undead ruler of France, Alexander. Their relationship was never very good, the neonate chaffing under the very rigid and authoritative Methuselah. \n In an act of rebellion, he took part in the Fourth Crusade, losing his childe Hugues in the process, for which he blames Alexander. Returning to Paris, Geoffrey eagerly took part in the conspiracy against his sire, which earned him the princedom of Paris. Still, everybody knows that Salianna is now the real power in France and Geoffrey is, once more, chaffing under a figure much more older and powerful than he is. \n Future fate in Canon \n The Ventrue crusader will never achieve much, succumbing to the same constant anger that plagued his sire. He was unable to even retain Paris and quickly lost all relevance in the grand scheme of French politics."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.goratrix:0 "One of the most powerful thaumaturgist in the world, Goratrix was the man behind the ritual that turned the Tremere Inner Council into Vampires. He is also to be credited with the creation of the Gargoyles. Ambitious, ruthless but also charismatic and determined, the magus was locked in a cold war with his rival Etrius for the control of the clan in Tremere's absence. A cold war he lost when Tremere awakened just long enough to exile Goratrix to France. \n Bitter at the idea, he still made good use of his new position, establishing a strong chantry in Rouen and a network of friends and allies. Some of those including the new power couple of the Kingdom, Salianna and Geoffrey. \n Future fate in Canon \n Goratrix's influence in France will grow until he is exiled for good and declares his antitribu. Becoming a founding father of the Sabbat, the prideful Tremere will then sacrifices himself, or be sacrificed depending on whom you ask, to permit the return of Tremere himself."
 POD_investigate.1.t.esclarmonde:0 "Lore: Esclarmonde"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.esclarmonde:0 "A true Occitan at heart, Esclarmonde was a noblewoman who has fought all her life, and unlife, for her homeland, be it against the Moors or arrogant French. Nominally a Queen of Love under the rule of Paris, the fair minded ruler always prized her independence and has payed dearly for it. \n As the Albigensian Crusade closes around her realm, Esclarmonde has been thrown to the wolves by the greedy northerners, who are now surprised to see her endure and survive this new threat once again. Even as everything burns around her, the 'Black Queen' isn't ready to give up. \n Future fate in Canon \n Esclarmonde will miraculously defends her realm against the Crusaders and the northerners for several decades longer. In the end, it is the betrayal of her close friend, Beatrix, that will doom her."
 POD_investigate.1.t.guillaume:0 "Lore: Guillaume de Lorris"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.guillaume:0 "The young author of the 'Roman de la Rose' has taken the French Vampires by storm. Enamored by his quick wit and perfect description of the courtly love, many Toreador yearned for the permission to embrace him. To everyone's surprise, it was an outsider, perfect in her beauty and charisma, that won the 'auction'. \n The embrace wasn't kind on Guillaume though, with his psyche shattered and his vivid imagination gone, replaced by an unfathomable despair. Already forgotten by his sire, the broken poet's future sounds bleak indeed. \n Future fate in Canon \n One night, Guillaume will change his name and be at the top of the Cainite ladder. He will just have to sacrifice everything to get there."
 POD_investigate.1.t.isouda:0 "Lore: Isouda de Blaise"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.isouda:0 "The willful Isouda never let anyone get in her way. At a young age, she flees a forced marriage to join another court. Some time later, she bites the hand of a too close for comfort old nobleman. Her burning spirit, ruthless ambition and comely beauty earned her the embrace. \n Isouda was as quick to adapt to Vampire society as you would expect. Organizing the exile or 'disappearance' of her sister Melusine and other rivals, she rose to the throne of Anjou. Thwarted in her attempt to grab France after Alexander's exile, Isouda is already planning a bloody vengeance against Salianna. Or anyone else who isn't firmly in her thrall for that matter. \n Isouda will navigate the French politics with the same reckless attitude she always had. As such, she ends up in the Sabbat to overthrow the Camarilla's hold on the country in modern nights."
 POD_investigate.1.t.helene:0 "Lore: Helene la Juste"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.helene:0 "Heir apparent to Salianna, Helene was a comely young lady skilled in all forms of arts when she caught the eye of the Matriarch. She was embraced younger than intended, as a result of a deadly fever that could have taken her. As such, Helene retains a form of youthful bravado and confidence that delights her sire. \n Far from an idiot though, the young Queen of Champagne has already given precious advice to her sire, and carefully balance a web of informants and allies of her own. All the while happily dancing and listening to romantic stories in her great hall. Salianna appears overprotective of her fickle childe, but Helene's courtiers can testify that she knows how to take care of herself. However, her close relationship with her sire makes her a prime target to anyone wanting to harm the Matriarch. And that is a lot of potential candidates."
 POD_investigate.1.t.veronique:0 "Lore: Veronique d'Orleans"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.veronique:0 "Veronique is an odd Cainite, rumored to be way too fond of mortals, even going as far as treating them like people. The Brujah just shrugs at these accusations and carries on, devoted to her chosen road. This oddity doesn't make her a pariah though, as she has demonstrated a very good political sense when she participated in the coup against Alexander. \n She lost a lot in the process though, with the betrayal of Jean Baptiste de Montrond. As such she has chosen to take a step back from Parisian politics to go back to her native Orleans. But trouble is never far from one such as Veronique. \n Future fate in Canon \n Indeed, the Brujah will not spent the rest of her unlife quietly in Orleans. After some serious twists of fate, she is now the Camarilla Prince of Macau where she, once again, demonstrates her acute diplomatic sense."
 POD_investigate.1.t.anatole:0 "Lore: Anatole"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.anatole:0 "Anatole always had a higher calling. Hearing God's voice and preaching his faith to the world was made easier for him when he was embraced by a pious sire. Wandering through Europe, the Malkavian met his first lifelong friend, one Lucita of Aragon. The odd duo participated in the Bitter Crusade and its aftermath, uncovering secrets, plots and preaching Anatole's strange visions to the world. \n They finally parted ways when he felt drawn to a young orphaned neonate, Zoe of the Ravnos. Traveling with her, and teaching her, they have come to France where Anatole was critical in destroying the Heretic leader known as St-Lys. Now, Anatole and his pupil have moved south to hunt the remaining heretics and learn from each other a little while longer. \n Future fate in Canon \n Anatole will never stop wandering and making friends, but his faith will dwindle, making him more of a Gehenna prophet than an holy man in his later years. His companionship and adventures with Lucita will become legendary."
 POD_investigate.1.t.etienne:0 "Lore: Etienne de Poitiers"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.etienne:0 "The only official 'King of Love' is an oddity for many reasons. Considered vapid and absent minded by many, he proved them all wrong by carefully manipulating Alexander into open conflict with Esclarmonde before the former's exile. Since then, his actions are watched with more attention, especially his relationship with the remnants of Avalon south of him. Nobody really knows if Etienne is a pawn or a king in the grand game. But it might be too late if they ever find out."
 POD_investigate.1.t.silvester:0 "Lore: Silvester de Ruiz"
 POD_investigate.1.desc.silvester:0 "De Ruiz's life really began at Covadonga, the day that a Christian army repelled a Muslim one for the first time. Silvester was a spy at this time, and discovered the road taken by the Muslim and, in a daring move, even offered his services to them to make sure they couldn't escape their doom. \n The Lasombra quietly watched, and it was Cleobolus who was the quicker to embrace the now famous rogue. Since then, Silvester's ascension has been impressive, becoming the youngest member of the Amici Nocti and the leader of the clan in Iberia in less than 500 years. He only has to finish the Reconquista and the whole clan could be his. \n Future fate in Canon \n Unfortunately for him, Silvester finds an even better Jyhad player than him, his own childe. Moncada mounts a coup and ends De Ruiz promising career in 1424."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.badr:0 "The last hope of the Iberian Ashirra, Badr is rallying her supporters to mount a final counterattack on the encroaching Christian. But the sultan of Granada has already alienated many potential allies with her callousness, branding many of them as heretics. \n Worse, she has to mask her appearance in a cloak of shadows, convinced that the revelation that she is a woman would shatter the fragile unity of purpose that she is creating. As she becomes more and more radicalized and ruthless, many are leaving the fight before it even began, leaving her in a precarious position. It might be that Badr is her own worst enemy after all."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.moncada:0 "Moncada was always a conflicted man. A burning ambition and utter ruthlessness mixed with a staunch true faith in God made for a very strong potential. And a potential he exploited well indeed. First by becoming an Archbishop of the Church, then by being embraced by the rising star of the Lasombra Clan. \n Determined to obtain the ultimate power over Clan Lasombra for the glory of God, Ambrosio will stop at nothing to achieve his divine ordained goal. Except maybe the eyes and soul of one peculiar Aragonese princess... \n Future fate in Canon \n Moncada will realize his ambition, bringing the Lasombra Clan into the Sabbat and under his thrall for the greater glory of God. Nothing will be able to stop him, until the betrayal by his prodigal daughter."

 POD_investigate.1.desc.lucita:0 "Daughter of King Alfonso II of Aragon, Lucita was never fit for royalty. Chaffing under the constraints due to her role as a princess, she was given to the care of an Archbishop named Ambrosio Luis Moncada. The Lasombra greatly admired her fierce spirit and indomitable will and soon embraced her. \n Since then, Lucita has been a major asset to her clan and sire, participating in the Bitter Crusade and its aftermath, bringing back Alfonzo of Venice into the Lasombra fold, and organizing the fight against the Iberian Muslims. Lucita's star is shining brighter than ever, but she is once again chaffing under the weight of Ambrosio's authority... \n Future fate in Canon \n Lucita will participate in almost all major events of Cainite history, but her faith and drive will waver. Seeking solace and redemption, she will betray her sire, only to find herself becoming more like him."

What he saw here haunts him to this night, and will continue to do so for his whole existence. \n Future fate in Canon \n Elieser will join the Sabbat, mostly in an attempt to topple the Castle of Shadows' horrors.

As a powerful and dedicated warrior in an influential faction of his clan, he was even in line to become the next Caliph, the master of Alamut warriors. Sadly for him, Assamites' politics are as deadly as their blades, and Hilel wasn't ready for those. \n Having lost his supporters, he faced exile with a stalwart composure, but a broken will. Retreating in Cordoba, Hilel was made Prince of the city against his will, due to his combat prowess and his ability to defend it against the Reconquista. Hilel is nothing if not dutiful and he will protect Cordoba, but the fate of the rest of Iberia, or the world for that matter, doesn't concern him anymore. \n Future fate in Canon \n The final siege of Cordoba by the Christians will be the last battle for Hilel.

As an ancilla, he discovered the ancient writings of his strange faith and has made it his sacred mission to bring those teachings to the world.

Soon, very soon, Josephus intends to march on Rome to spread the glory of his faith to the Papal seat. \n Future fate in Canon \n Around 1240, the Cainite Heresy will mount an assault against this heresy of their own.

 POD_investigate.1.desc.rafael:0 "Rafael's life is an exercise in setbacks and rebounds. A failed priest, his natural charm allowed him to persuade some monks to let him stay at a monastery, and he delighted in producing subtly erotic art to amuse his audience. This easy and lightly deviant life pleased him, until one Callisti y Castillo, a 'native Pagan witch' took interest in him. \n Rafael wanted nothing to do with the powerful Toreador, but was soon embraced against his will to create more art for her. Unfortunately, it appears that he was not the actual artist, and had very few talents himself. Thrown into a rage, his sire almost killed him on the spot but Corazon managed, once again, to talk his way out of trouble. Since then, he handles the considerable influence and power of his slowly drifting away sire. \n Future fate in Canon \n Rafael will put the greatest hoax of Cainite politics when he is chosen to be the Toreador leader for the Camarilla.

This has made her many enemies, the Jewish resenting her conversion, and the Muslims feeling a lack of sincerity on her part. \n Almost isolated, Gerushah hasn't made a critical mistake yet and Sevilla's throne is still hers. This shows a keen mind for politics, and her intent is to use Badr's war effort to secure her position, or get a better one. And if everything comes crashing around her, Gerushah has an ace in the hole she might be able to play. \n Future fate in Canon \n Gerushah will be able to hold on to her power for a little while longer, even surviving a Baali plot against her city.

Nahir's eyes stopped on Zamra, a young widow known for her ferociously independent spirit. \n Nahir overpowered her and embraced her against her will, but he also took a torch to the face when he asked his new childe to devour her own children to prove her loyalty. It then took a lowly fourteen years for Zamra to be acclaimed as Prince of Algiers and start extending her influence on all the Maghreb. Nahir certainly won his bet, but he might have created a political monster. \n Future fate in Canon \n Zamra will take no sides during the Anarch revolt, simply crushing anyone that thought her weak. Weary of the constant assassinations attempts, she will be tricked into a sect named 'Inconnu' where she will achieve a place at the higher seat.

Ibn Jabar wishes to deal as little as possible with other Cainites. As such, he is assisted by a panoply of Ansar, skilled helpers ordering the city for him. This competent group, and the threat of facing ibn Jabar's temper, has kept the peace so far. But Fez has yet to face a true threat."
