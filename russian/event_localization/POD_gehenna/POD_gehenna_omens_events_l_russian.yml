Lucia was cured magically by from an illness from Lucia's prayers. Lucia then refused to marry a pagan she was betrothed. The pagans tried to burn her at stake, but failed.  They stabbed her in the throat with spear, but she would not stop speaking. They gouged out her eyes, but they were miraculously restored. She would not die until a priest gave her Christian Last Rights.\n\nHer body lay undisturbed in Sicily for 400 years. Then the relics were moved to Constantinople for safe keeping from Saracen incursions. Then her corpse disappeared during the sacking of Constantinople in 1204 and the ruin of Michael's dream.\n\nWhy has God returned to the ways of the Old Testament by punishing the wicked men of Frisia with this epic deluge on St. Lucia's holy night? Many of these souls had accepted the faith of the Fishers and seek to journey paradise of the Far Shores. Sante Lucia calls on us to return to the Road of Heaven."
