 culture_era_dark_fantastic_desc:0 "the Renaissance era of the World of Darkness is the setting of Mage: The Sorcerers Crusade. Like the Dark Medieval era of Vampire: The Dark Ages before it, the Dark Fantastic is a more conspiratorial version of its historical era, haunted by the beasts of nightmares and demons outside human understanding. However, the Dark Fantastic is a more wondrous setting as well, as befits both the high-fantasy character of Mage: The Ascension and the spirit of the historical Renaissance itself."
 culture_era_gothic_victorian:0 "Gothic Victorian"
 culture_era_gothic_victorian_desc:0 "The name 'Gothic Victorian' references the two sensibilities that inform the setting: the brooding, doomed romanticism of classical Gothic fiction, and the reign of Queen Victoria I of the United Kingdom, who ruled the British Empire from June 20, 1837 until her death on January 22, 1901. These two sensibilities both infer a concern with radical social change as it alternately coexists and clashes with the repressive weight of tradition. The Gothic Victorian age as featured in Victorian Age: Vampire spans the years 1890 to 1897, and ends not with Victoria's death but with the publication of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula – an event which rocked the the Kindred world to its core. The Gothic Victorian period partially overlaps with the Savage West (or "Wyld West"), the setting of Werewolf: The Wild West, although the theme and tone of the two settings differ significantly. The forthcoming Victorian Mage for Mage: The Ascension will also deal with the Victorian Age"

 culture_era_final_nights_desc:0 "In Cainite eschatology, the Final Nights are the nights before the coming of Gehenna and the end of vampires. Much of the basis for belief in the Final Nights originates with Noddist lore. Specifically, the Book of Nod. The Final Nights are supposed to be predated by several signs which indicate great changes in Cainite society and the imminent wakening of the Antediluvians, such as a rise in the number of thin-blooded vampires, Princedoms ruled by Caitiff, and Kuei-jin invading the West. It is said that the majority of vampires have a sense of impending doom during the Final Nights"
